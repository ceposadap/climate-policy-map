3605659,Some reflections on combining meta-analysis and structural equation modeling,"Meta-analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) are 2 of the most prominent statistical techniques employed in the behavioral, medical, and social sciences. They each have their own well-established research communities, terminologies, statistical models, software packages, and journals (Research Synthesis Methods and Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal). In this paper, I will provide some personal reflections on combining meta-analysis and SEM in the forms of meta-analytic SEM and SEM-based meta-analysis. The critical contributions of Becker (1992), Shadish (1992), and Viswesvaran and Ones (1995) in the early development of meta-analytic SEM are highlighted. Another goal of the paper is to illustrate how meta-analysis can be extended and integrated with other techniques to address new research questions such as the analysis of Big Data. I hope that this paper may stimulate more research development in the area of combining meta-analysis and SEM.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3606326,The Struggle for Evidence in Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine: Publication Rate of Randomized Controlled Trials and Systematic Reviews Is Growing More Than in Other Therapeutic Fields,"Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of publication of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis in physical and rehabilitation medicine and its variation over time. Design We performed a bibliometric study and searched PubMed from inception to 2017, using National Library of Medicine 3rd level MeSH terms (""rehabilitation,"" ""physical therapy modalities,"" and ""drug therapy"") and filters (""randomized controlled trial,"" ""systematic reviews,"" and ""meta-analysis""). We used descriptive statistics, and we calculated the best-fitting regression model for all data considered. Results The absolute number of articles is growing in rehabilitation as much as in other treatment fields such as drug therapy. Whereas the rate of growth of publications for all studies relative to PubMed is bigger for drug therapies than for rehabilitation and physical therapy, the rate of growth of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis is significantly greater for rehabilitation and physical therapy (P < 0.001). In 2017, 19.3% and 28.2% of the total production of scientific articles for rehabilitation and physical therapy (respectively) were for randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews versus 11.3% for drug therapy. Conclusions Production of the highest form of research evidence (randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis) is continuously increasing in physical and rehabilitation medicine at a higher rate than in other treatment fields such as drug therapy. The quality and results of this evidence should be evaluated in future studies. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3593774,Past and Current Use of Walking Measures for Children With Spina Bifida: A Systematic Review,"Objectives: To describe walking measurement in children with spina bifida and to identify patterns in the use of walking measures in this population. Data Sources: Seven medical databases Medline, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and AMED-were searched from the earliest known record until March 11, 2014. Search terms encompassed 3 themes: (1) children; (2) spina bifida; and (3) walking. Study Selection: Articles were included if participants were children with spina bifida aged 1 to 17 years and if walking was measured. Articles were excluded if the assessment was restricted to kinematic, kinetic, or electromyographic analysis of walking. A total of 1751 abstracts were screened by 2 authors independently, and 109 articles were included in this review. Data Extraction: Data were extracted using standardized forms. Extracted data included study and participant characteristics and details about the walking measures used, including psychometric properties. Two authors evaluated the methodological quality of articles using a previously published framework that considers sampling method, study design, and psychometric properties of the measures used. Data Synthesis: Nineteen walking measures were identified. Ordinal-level rating scales (eg, Hoffer Functional Ambulation Scale) were most commonly used (57% of articles), followed by ratio-level, spatiotemporal measures, such as walking speed (18% of articles). Walking was measured for various reasons relevant to multiple health care disciplines. A machine learning analysis was used to identify patterns in the use of walking measures. The learned classifier predicted whether a spatiotemporal measure was used with 77.1% accuracy. A trend to use spatiotemporal measures in older children and those with lumbar and sacral spinal lesions was identified. Most articles were prospective studies that used samples of convenience and unblinded assessors. Few articles evaluated or considered the psychometric properties of the walking measures used. Conclusions: Despite a demonstrated need to Measure walking in children with spina bifida, few valid, reliable, and responsive measures have been established for this population.

3606278,Accredited Endovascular Surgical Neuroradiology Programs: Current Specialty Composition and Academic Impact Using the h Index,"Background: Concerns exist that neurosurgery might fail to lead the field of endovascular surgical neuroradiology (ESN), as other specialties are allowed to train and practice ESN. This study aimed to assess the current breakdown of specialties and their relative academic productivity in accredited ESN fellowship programs. Methods: A list of fellowship programs was obtained from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and Committee on Advanced Subspecialty Training directories. Primary specialty (i.e., residency) training for each faculty member in these programs was determined using information provided by the programs. A bibliometric search was performed for each member using Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA). Cumulative and ESN-specific h indices were calculated; h indices were compared between each specialty group and between international medical graduates and US medical graduates, regardless of specialty training. Results: Thirty-one ESN fellowship programs with 88 faculty members were included. Neurosurgeons constituted 61.4% (n = 54) of the total ESN faculty, followed by radiologists with 30.7% (n = 27), and neurologists with 7.9% (n = 7). The mean ESN-specific h index for neurosurgery-trained ESN faculty was 16.2 ± 14.6 compared with 14.4 ± 10.9 for radiologists and 13.0 ± 12.6 for neurologists (P = 0.76). There were 12 IMGs and 76 USMGs. The mean ESN-specific h index was greater for IMGs than USMGs, 24.7 ± 14.3 versus 14.0 ± 12.7 (P = 0.008), respectively. Conclusions: Neurosurgery is leading the ESN field in numbers; however, the h index is not significantly different among ESN faculty based on primary training. The number of IMGs is relatively small, yet IMGs have significantly higher mean h indices. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",1,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3594287,Internal to Common Carotid Artery Peak Systolic Velocity Ratios for Predicting North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial Stenosis: Derivation/Validation Study Using a Machine Learning Technique,"The association between internal carotid artery/peak systolic velocity and stenosis severity as measured by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial is known. The association of internal carotid artery peak systolic velocity to common carotid artery peak systolic velocity ratio is less well studied. We use a machine learning algorithm to study this association. We performed a meta-analysis of papers with point data showing graphs of internal carotid artery/peak systolic velocity ratio versus North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial percent stenosis. We used a neural net algorithm to derive an equation relating internal carotid artery/common carotid artery peak systolic velocity to % stenosis in a derivation group (two thirds of the data points) and applied it to a validation subset (one third of the data points). Model performance was assessed by correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analyses. We found 4 papers with appropriate data for a total of 775 data points. The mean % stenosis was 53% (26% SD) with a mean internal carotid artery/common carotid artery peak systolic velocity ratio of 3.9 (2.9 SD). The derivation data set (n = 516) showed an association with an r value of 0.76 (P <.0001) between predicted and measured stenosis. Applying the derived equation to the validation subset (n = 259) showed a similar association (r = 0.8; P <.0001). A machine learning algorithm gave a good approximation of the association between internal carotid artery/common carotid artery peak systolic velocity ratio and % stenosis on a continuous scale for the aggregate data of 4 published studies. These data could be used to study the accuracy of different cut-points for 50% and 70% stenosis in an unbiased fashion. © 2019, Society for Vascular Ultrasound.",1,1,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
3594344,Measurement of physical activity in clinical practice using accelerometers,"Accelerometers are commonly used in clinical and epidemiological research for more detailed measures of physical activity and to target the limitations of self-report methods. Sensors are attached at the hip, wrist and thigh, and the acceleration data are processed and calibrated in different ways to determine activity intensity, body position and/or activity type. Simple linear modelling can be used to assess activity intensity from hip and thigh data, whilst more advanced machine-learning modelling is to prefer for the wrist. The thigh position is most optimal to assess body position and activity type using machine-learning modelling. Frequency filtering and measurement resolution needs to be considered for correct assessment of activity intensity. Simple physical activity measures and statistical methods are mostly used to investigate relationship with health, but do not take advantage of all information provided by accelerometers and do not consider all components of the physical activity behaviour and their interrelationships. More advanced statistical methods are suggested that analyse patterns of multiple measures of physical activity to demonstrate stronger and more specific relationships with health. However, evaluations of accelerometer methods show considerable measurement errors, especially at individual level, which interferes with their use in clinical research and practice. Therefore, better objective methods are needed with improved data processing and calibration techniques, exploring both simple linear and machine-learning alternatives. Development and implementation of accelerometer methods into clinical research and practice requires interdisciplinary collaboration to cover all aspects contributing to useful and accurate measures of physical activity behaviours related to health. © 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3606636,Cancer research in the Arab world: A review of publications from seven countries between 2000–2013,"This review aimed to examine trends in cancer research in the Arab world and identify existing research gaps. A search of the MEDLINE® database (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) was undertaken for all cancer-related publications published between January 2000 and December 2013 from seven countries, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine and Sudan. A total of 1,773 articles were identified, with a significant increase in yearly publications over time (P <0.005). Only 30.6% of the publications included subjects over the age of 50 years old. There was a dearth of cross-sectional/correlational studies (8.8%), randomised controlled trials (2.4%) and systematic reviews/meta-analyses (1.3%). Research exploring cancer associations mainly considered social and structural determinants of health (27.1%), followed by behavioural risk factors (14.1%), particularly tobacco use. Overall, more cancer research is needed in the Arab world, particularly analytical studies with high-quality evidence and those focusing on older age groups and associations with physical activity and diet. © 2017, Sultan Qaboos University.

2116030,"Adaptive capacity to climate change: A synthesis of concepts, methods, and findings in a fragmented field","Adaptive capacity is an important element of long-term adaptation to climate change and is the focus of a rapidly growing body of research. Interdisciplinary growth has the potential to introduce new methods and insights, but it could also cause fragmentation and hamper methodological development or limit transfer of academic insights to climate change adaptation practice. This article uses qualitative content, bibliometric, and citation network analyses to systematically review the scope, methods, and findings of 276 studies on adaptive capacity of social and social-ecological systems. The review demonstrates that adaptive capacity research is highly interdisciplinary; covers a wide range of sectors, geographic locations, and scales of analysis; and is highly fragmented. The majority of empirical studies are isolated by lack of comparative work and cross-field citation. Forty-six percent of studies reviewed do not cite prior works on adaptive capacity: even those on similar topics in the same geographic location. Methods to assess adaptive capacity have proliferated to include more than 64 indicator-based indices or frameworks and 37 proxy outcome measures. The article argues that lack of either consensus or debate across the literature raises concerns that scientific progress in the field may be constrained and the ability of adaptive capacity research to inform adaptation practice may be limited. To promote consistency and transparency in future work, 158 determinants of adaptive capacity are defined and illustrated with common assessment indicators and examples. Additional opportunities for progress are noted with suggestions for future research.

3597619,A visual approach to validate the selection review of primary studies in systematic reviews: A replication study,"One of the activities associated with the systematic literature review (SLR) process is the selection of primary studies. When the researcher faces large volumes of primary studies to be analysed, the process used to select studies can be arduous, specially when the selection review activity is performed and all studies under analysis are read more than once. An experiment was conducted as a pilot test to compare the performance and accuracy of graduate students in conducting the selection review activity manually and using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. This paper describes a replication study that used the same experimental design and materials of the original experiment. The results have confirmed the outcomes of the original experiment, i.e., VTM is promising and can improve the performance of the selection review of primary studies. There is a positive relationship between the use of VTM techniques and the time spent to conduct the selection review activity.

3605557,Microalgae harvesting by fungal-assisted bioflocculation,"Although the production of biofuels from microalgae has numerous advantages over other raw materials, its large-scale application still comes across economic aspects. In this context, the concept of biorefinery emerges as a strategy to increase the sustainability of this process. Studies have been developed to reduce production costs, especially to optimize the harvesting stage. Among the techniques used, bioflocculation is a promising alternative to traditional harvesting methods, as it is viable in terms of cost, execution and efficiency and, above all, it is a more environmentally appropriate method. This study aimed to perform a bibliometric and systematic review of traditional algal harvesting techniques and the mechanisms governing the different interactions of microorganisms used as bioflocculants, especially fungi. The high efficiencies of microalgae harvesting, combined with the possibility of cultivation in wastewater and the various bioproducts originated from this biomass, show the potential application of bioflocculation in the context of integrated biorefineries.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3606347,Evolution of homeopathy: A scientometric analysis of global homeopathy literature between 1975 and 2017,"Objective: Scientometrics is the evaluation of scientific literature in a certain field. Although popularity and use of homeopathy have increased in the recent years, scientific literature lacks a bibliometric or scientometric evaluation of homeopathy literature. Methods: We collected all data of this study from four databases provided by Web of Science. All documents published between 1975 and 2017 were included. The keywords we searched for in detail were “homeopathy” “homeopathic” “homoeopathy” and “homoeopathic”. We used Spearman's correlation test to investigate a possible correlation between publication numbers or the productivity and features of the countries. We created infographics and infomaps by using GunnMap and VOSviewer sources. Gross domestic product (GDP) ranking data of countries was procured from The World Data Bank. Results: Our search retrieved a total of 4183 articles. The great majority of documents were original articles (n = 3043, 72.75%). The UK dominated homeopathy literature with 950 articles followed by the USA, Germany, India and Brazil (n = 636, 590, 277 and 246 items, respectively). Switzerland was found to be most productive country (20.41) followed by the UK, Norway and Israel (14.35, 11.31 and 8.41, respectively). University of Exeter (UK) was the leading institutions with 204 items (4.88%). Most productive journal was Homeopathy dominating and covering 24% of all literature. We detected very high correlation between publication number and citation number by year (r = 0.95, p < 0.001). A high correlation was measured between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and productivity of the countries. A moderate correlation was measured between GDP and publication number of the countries (r = 0.66 and p < 0.001). In scientometric network analysis, the USA, the UK and Germany were noted to be three major association centers. Conclusions: We detected that developed countries dominated homeopathy literature and we suggest that physicians from least-developed and developing countries should be funded and encouraged to carry out homeopathy studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3597438,Protein-protein interaction identification using a hybrid model,"Background: Most existing systems that identify protein-protein interaction (PPI) in literature make decisions solely on evidence within a single sentence and ignore the rich context of PPI descriptions in large corpora. Moreover, they often suffer from the heavy burden of manual annotation. Methods: To address these problems, a new relational-similarity (RS)-based approach exploiting context in large-scale text is proposed. A basic RS model is first established to make initial predictions. Then word similarity matrices that are sensitive to the PPI identification task are constructed using a corpus-based approach. Finally, a hybrid model is developed to integrate the word similarity model with the basic RS model. Results: The experimental results show that the basic RS model achieves F-scores much higher than a baseline of random guessing on interactions (from 50.6% to 75.0%) and non-interactions (from 49.4% to 74.2%). The hybrid model further improves F-score by about 2% on interactions and 3% on non-interactions. Conclusion: The experimental evaluations conducted with PPIs in well-known databases showed the effectiveness of our approach that explores context information in PPI identification. This investigation confirmed that within the framework of relational similarity, the word similarity model relieves the data sparseness problem in similarity calculation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3594571,Electronic monitoring in bipolar disorder,"Major reasons for the insufficient effects of current treatment options in bipolar disorder include delayed intervention for pro-dromal depressive and manic symptoms and decreased adherence to psychopharmacological treatment. The reliance on subjective information and clinical evaluations when diagnosing and assessing the severity of depressive and manic symptoms calls for less biased and more objective markers. By using electronic devices, fine-grained data on complex psychopathological aspects of bipolar disorder can be evaluated unobtrusively over the long term. Moreover, electronic data could possibly represent candidate markers of diagnosis and illness activity in bipolar disorder and allow for early and individualized intervention for prodromal symptoms outside clinical settings. The present dissertation concerns the use of electronic monitoring as a marker and treatment intervention in bipolar disorder and investigated the scientific literature and body of evidence within the area, which includes ten original study reports and two systematic reviews, one of which included a meta-analysis, con-ducted by the author of the dissertation. Taken together, the literature presented in this dissertation illustrates that 1) smartphone-based electronic self-monitoring of mood seems to reflect clinically assessed depressive and manic symptoms and enables the long-term characterization of mood instability in bipolar disorder; 2) preliminary results suggest that smartphone-based automatically generated data (e.g. the number of text messages sent/day; the number of incoming and outgoing calls/day; the number of changes in cell tower IDs/day; and voice features) seem to reflect clinically assessed depressive and manic symptoms in bipolar disorder; 3) smartphone-based electronic self-monitoring had no effects on the severity of depressive and manic symptoms in bipolar disorder, according to a randomized controlled trial; and 4) electronic monitoring of psychomotor activity and heart rate variability seems to reflect illness activity in bipolar disorder and differentiate between patients with bipolar disorder and healthy control individuals. These findings point toward the usefulness of electronic monitoring as a marker of illness in bipolar disorder. Using electronic monitoring as a treatment intervention could provide innovative and novel interventions on-demand with a potential global reach, filling the gap between availability and the need for treatment. However, future studies using rigorous methodology and more randomized controlled trials that carefully investigate the positive effects and possible harmful effects of electronic monitoring in bipolar disorder are needed. In addition, patient safety, privacy issues, data security and legal aspects are major concerns that must be considered and addressed when using electronic monitoring. © 2018, Danish Medical Association.

3606787,Publication analysis on insomnia: How much has been done in the past two decades?,"Insomnia has been a rising public concern in recent years. As one example of a multidisciplinary topic, the theme of insomnia research has gradually shifted over time; however, there is very little quantitative characterization of the research trends in insomnia. The current study aims to quantitatively analyze trends in insomnia publications for the past 20 years. We retrospectively analyzed insomnia-related publications retrieved from PubMed and Google Scholar between 1994 and from a number of different perspectives. We investigated the major areas of research focus for insomnia, journal characteristics, as well as trends in clinical management and treatment modalities. The resulting 5841 publications presented an exponential growth trend over the past two decades, with mean annual growth rates at nearly 10% for each publication type. Analysis of major research focuses indicated that depression, hypnotics and sedatives, questionnaires, and polysomnography are the most common topics at present. Furthermore, we found that while studies on drug therapy and adverse effects decreased in the most recent five years, the greatest expansion of insomnia publications were in the areas of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and alternative therapies. Collectively, insomnia publications present a continuous trend of increase. While sedative and hypnotic drugs dominated the treatment of insomnia, non-pharmacological therapies may have great potential for advancement in future years. Future research effort is warranted for novel tools and clinical trials, especially on insomnia treatments with inadequate evidence or not-yet-clear efficacy and side effects. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2,2,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3605859,Meta-analysis in psychology: a bibliometric study,"Meta-analysis refers to the statistical methods used in research synthesis for combining and integrating results from individual studies. The present study draws on the strengths of bibliometric methods in order to offer an overview of meta-analytic research activity in psychology, as well as to characterize its most important aspects and their evolution over time. A total of 2,874 articles published in scientific journals were identified and standard bibliometric indicators (e.g., number of articles, productivity by country, and national and international collaborations) and laws (e.g., Price's and Lotka's law) were applied to these data. The results suggest a clear upward trend not only in the number of articles published since the 1970s (with a peak of productivity in 2010), but also in both the number of authors by article (, SD = 1.53) and internationalization, especially since the 1990s. The interest in meta-analysis extends to many authors (n = 5,445), countries (n = 44) and scientific journals (n = 394), as well as to several areas of psychology that mostly fit a growing exponential model.

3590534,Current approaches to identify sections within clinical narratives from electronic health records: a systematic review,"Background: The identification of sections in narrative content of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has demonstrated to improve the performance of clinical extraction tasks; however, there is not yet a shared understanding of the concept and its existing methods. The objective is to report the results of a systematic review concerning approaches aimed at identifying sections in narrative content of EHR, using both automatic or semi-automatic methods. Methods: This review includes articles from the databases: SCOPUS, Web of Science and PubMed (from January 1994 to September 2018). The selection of studies was done using predefined eligibility criteria and applying the PRISMA recommendations. Search criteria were elaborated by using an iterative and collaborative keyword enrichment. Results: Following the eligibility criteria, 39 studies were selected for analysis. The section identification approaches proposed by these studies vary greatly depending on the kind of narrative, the type of section, and the application. We observed that 57% of them proposed formal methods for identifying sections and 43% adapted a previously created method. Seventy-eight percent were intended for English texts and 41% for discharge summaries. Studies that are able to identify explicit (with headings) and implicit sections correspond to 46%. Regarding the level of granularity, 54% of the studies are able to identify sections, but not subsections. From the technical point of view, the methods can be classified into rule-based methods (59%), machine learning methods (22%) and a combination of both (19%). Hybrid methods showed better results than those relying on pure machine learning approaches, but lower than rule-based methods; however, their scope was more ambitious than the latter ones. Despite all the promising performance results, very few studies reported tests under a formal setup. Almost all the studies relied on custom dictionaries; however, they used them in conjunction with a controlled terminology, most commonly the UMLS (R) metathesaurus. Conclusions: Identification of sections in EHR narratives is gaining popularity for improving clinical extraction projects. This study enabled the community working on clinical NLP to gain a formal analysis of this task, including the most successful ways to perform it.",2,2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
3591387,Patient healthcare trajectory. An essential monitoring tool: a systematic review,"Background: Patient healthcare trajectory is a recent emergent topic in the literature, encompassing broad concepts. However, the rationale for studying patients' trajectories, and how this trajectory concept is defined remains a public health challenge. Our research was focused on patients' trajectories based on disease management and care, while also considering medico-economic aspects of the associated management. We illustrated this concept with an example: a myocardial infarction (MI) occurring in a patient's hospital trajectory of care. The patient follow-up was traced via the prospective payment system. We applied a semi-automatic text mining process to conduct a comprehensive review of patient healthcare trajectory studies. This review investigated how the concept of trajectory is defined, studied and what it achieves. Methods: We performed a PubMed search to identify reports that had been published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 2000 and October 31, 2015. Fourteen search questions were formulated to guide our review. A semi-automatic text mining process based on a semantic approach was performed to conduct a comprehensive review of patient healthcare trajectory studies. Text mining techniques were used to explore the corpus in a semantic perspective in order to answer non-a priori questions. Complementary review methods on a selected subset were used to answer a priori questions. Results: Among the 33,514 publications initially selected for analysis, only 70 relevant articles were semi-automatically extracted and thoroughly analysed. Oncology is particularly prevalent due to its already well-established processes of care. For the trajectory thema, 80% of articles were distributed in 11 clusters. These clusters contain distinct semantic information, for example health outcomes (29%), care process (26%) and administrative and financial aspects (16%). Conclusion: This literature review highlights the recent interest in the trajectory concept. The approach is also gradually being used to monitor trajectories of care for chronic diseases such as diabetes, organ failure or coronary artery and MI trajectory of care, to improve care and reduce costs. Patient trajectory is undoubtedly an essential approach to be further explored in order to improve healthcare monitoring.",1,1,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
3606021,Internet of things in medicine: A systematic mapping study,"Context: The current studies on IoT in healthcare have reviewed the uses of this technology in a combination of healthcare domains, including nursing, rehabilitation sciences, ambient assisted living (AAL), medicine, etc. However, no review study has scrutinized IoT advances exclusively in medicine irrespective of other healthcare domains. Objectives: The purpose of the current study was to identify and map the current IoT developments in medicine through providing graphical/tabular classifications on the current experimental and practical IoT information in medicine, the involved medical sub-fields, the locations of IoT use in medicine, and the bibliometric information about IoT research articles. Methods: In this systematic mapping study, the studies published between 2000 and 2018 in major online scientific databases, including IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed were screened. A total of 3679 papers were found from which 89 papers were finally selected based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: While the majority of medical IoT studies were experimental and prototyping in nature, they generally reported that home was the most popular place for medical IoT applications. It was also found that neurology, cardiology, and psychiatry/psychology were the medical sub-fields receiving the most IoT attention. Bibliometric analysis showed that IEEE Internet of Things Journal has published the most influential IoT articles. India, China and the United States were found to be the most involved countries in medical IoT research. Conclusions: Although IoT has not yet been employed in some medical sub-fields, recent substantial surge in the number of medical IoT studies will most likely lead to the engagement of more medical sub-fields in the years to come. IoT literature also shows that the ambiguity of assigning a variety of terms to IoT, namely system, platform, device, tool, etc., and the interchangeable uses of these terms require a taxonomy study to investigate the precise definition of these terms. Other areas of research have also been mentioned at the end of this article. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3594707,"The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in Electronic Health Records","Summary Background: The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is the World Health Organization's standard for describing health and health-related states. Examples of how the ICF has been used in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have not been systematically summarized and described yet. Objectives: To provide a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature about the ICF's use in EHRs, including related challenges and benefits. Methods: Peer-reviewed literature, published between January 2001 and July 2015 was retrieved from Medline ®, CINAHL ®, Scopus ®, and ProQuest ® Social Sciences using search terms related to ICF and EHR concepts. Publications were categorized according to three groups: Requirement specification, development and implementation. Information extraction was conducted according to a qualitative content analysis method, deductively informed by the evaluation framework for Health Information Systems: Human, Organization and Technology-fit (HOT-fit). Results: Of 325 retrieved articles, 17 publications were included; 4 were categorized as requirement specification, 7 as development, and 6 as implementation publications. Information regarding the HOT-fit evaluation framework was summarized. Main benefits of using the ICF in EHRs were its unique comprehensive perspective on health and its interdisciplinary focus. Main challenges included the fact that the ICF is not structured as a formal terminology as well as the need for a reduced number of ICF codes for more feasible and practical use. Conclusion: Different approaches and technical solutions exist for integrating the ICF in EHRs, such as combining the ICF with other existing standards for EHR or selecting ICF codes with natural language processing. Though the use of the ICF in EHRs is beneficial as this review revealed, the ICF could profit from further improvements such as formalizing the knowledge representation in the ICF to support and enhance interoperability.

3605587,Interactions among stakeholders in the processes of city logistics: a systematic review of the literature,"The aim of this article is to present a systematic review of the literature on urban logistics and its stakeholders and identify future research directions. In order to discuss the main contributions and trends of this theme, a combination of bibliometric analysis techniques, semantic and content and a technological prospection were performed. Through the evaluation of a sample group of seventy one articles, it was possible to trace paths and understand content approaches, identifying advantages, limitations and conditions for the good development of city logistics and its agents. Based on these findings, the low evidence of how effectively each of the stakeholders influencing the activities of city logistics stands out, since your heterogeneity and conflict of interest are singled out as the cause of the difficulty of this deployment. It is important to note that from the technological prospection was possible to identify the state of innovation on the world stage in the area studied.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1025398,From Numerical Model to Computational Intelligence: The Digital Transition of Urban Energy System,"With the development of digital technologies, especially big data analytics, digital innovations are taking root in various industries, including energy sector. Particularly, urban energy system is also experiencing digital transition; such digital transition not only offers new business models commercially, but also brings new research problems scientifically. The new capabilities enabled by these digital technologies are reshaping the generation, transmission, consumption and storage sections in the urban energy system, sequentially the traditional way of how urban energy system is designed and operated should be reexamined. Starting from here, there have been many studies regarding how various digital technologies can be applied all along the urban energy system value chain; these studies range from individuals' energy consumption pattern characterization by using customer behavior data in smart home, to complex data-driven planning of regional scale energy system. More specifically, numerous computational models have been proposed by the scientific community to mimic the dynamics of various components at various levels in the urban energy system. However, the potential benefits of applying these numerical models are somehow underestimated; we believe there are still several gaps from numerical modeling to computational intelligence which need to be bridged. In such a context, in this paper we strive to present a systematic review on the status of urban energy system related digital innovations as well as prospective outlook on the future application of such digital technologies. Through the study of this paper, we hope to identify several key points where digitalization should be prioritized in urban energy system, picture a roadmap towards future digital technology enabled intelligent urban energy system, and finally points out the research gaps that need to be fulfilled over there.

3606976,Lost in publication: Half of all renal practice evidence is published in non-renal journals,"Physicians often scan a select number of journals to keep up to date with practice evidence for patients with kidney conditions. This raises the question of where relevant studies are published. We performed a bibliometric analysis using 195 renal systematic reviews. Each review used a comprehensive method to identify all primary studies for a focused clinical question relevant to patient care. We compiled all the primary studies included in these reviews, and considered where each study was published. Of the 2779 studies, 1351 (49%) were published in the top 20 journals. Predictably, this list included Transplantation Proceedings (5.9% of studies), Kidney International (5.3%), American Journal of Kidney Diseases (4.7%), Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (4.3%), Transplantation (4.2%), and Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2.4%). Ten non-renal journals were also on this list, including New England Journal of Medicine (2.4%), Lancet (2.3%), and Diabetes Care (2.2%). The remaining 1428 (51%) studies were published across other 446 journals. When the disciplines of all journals were considered, 59 were classified as renal or transplant journals (42% of articles). Other specialties included general and internal medicine (16%), endocrinology (diabetes) and metabolism (6.5%), surgery (6.2%), cardiovascular diseases (6.1%), pediatrics (4.3%), and radiology (3.3%). About half of all renal practice evidence is published in non-renal journals. Browsing the top journals is important. However, relevant studies are also scattered across a large range of journals that may not be routinely scanned by busy physicians, and keeping up with this literature requires other continuing education strategies. © 2006 International Society of Nephrology.",1,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3594176,Detection of Bots in Social Media: A Systematic Review,"Social media bots (automated accounts) attacks are organized crimes that pose potential threats to public opinion, democracy, public health, stock market and other disciplines. While researchers are building many models to detect social media bot accounts, attackers, on the other hand, evolve their bots to evade detection. This everlasting cat and mouse game makes this field vibrant and demands continuous development. To guide and enhance future solutions, this work provides an overview of social media bots attacks, current detection methods and challenges in this area. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review based on a predefined search strategy, which includes literature concerned about social media bots detection methods, published between 2010 and 2019. The results of this review include a refined taxonomy of detection methods, a highlight of the techniques used to detect bots in social media and a comparison between current detection methods. Some of the gaps identified by this work are: the literature mostly focus on Twitter platform only and rarely use methods other than supervised machine learning, most of the public datasets are not accurate or large enough, integrated systems and real-time detection are required, and efforts to spread awareness are needed to arm legitimate users with knowledge. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2,2,,,,,,,,,,

3605556,"A Systematic Review of Blockchain in Healthcare: Frameworks, Prototypes, and Implementations","Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology has attracted the interests of stakeholders across several sectors including healthcare. Its & x2019; potential in the multi-stakeholder operated sector like health has been responsible for several investments, studies, and implementations. Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems traditionally used for the exchange of health information amongst healthcare stakeholders have been criticised for centralising power, failures and attack-points with exchange data custodians. EHRs have struggled in the face of multi-stakeholder and system requirements while adhering to security, privacy, ethical and other regulatory constraints. Blockchain is promising amongst others to address the many EHR challenges, primarily trustless and secure exchange of health information amongst stakeholders. Many blockchain-in-healthcare frameworks have been proposed; some prototyped and/or implemented. This study leveraged the PRISMA framework to systematically search and evaluate the different models proposed; prototyped and/or implemented. The bibliometric and functional distribution of all 143 articles from this study were presented. This study evaluated 61 articles that discussed either prototypes or pilot or implementations. The technical and architectural analysis of these 61 articles for privacy, security, cost, and performance were detailed. Blockchain was found to solve the trust, security and privacy constraints of traditional EHRs often at significant performance, storage and cost trade-offs.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3591674,Software Maintainability: Systematic Literature Review and Current Trends,"Software maintenance is an expensive activity that consumes a major portion of the cost of the total project. Various activities carried out during maintenance include the addition of new features, deletion of obsolete code, correction of errors, etc. Software maintainability means the ease with which these operations can be carried out. If the maintainability can be measured in early phases of the software development, it helps in better planning and optimum resource utilization. Measurement of design properties such as coupling, cohesion, etc. in early phases of development often leads us to derive the corresponding maintainability with the help of prediction models. In this paper, we performed a systematic review of the existing studies related to software maintainability from January 1991 to October 2015. In total, 96 primary studies were identified out of which 47 studies were from journals, 36 from conference proceedings and 13 from others. All studies were compiled in structured form and analyzed through numerous perspectives such as the use of design metrics, prediction model, tools, data sources, prediction accuracy, etc. According to the review results, we found that the use of machine learning algorithms in predicting maintainability has increased since 2005. The use of evolutionary algorithms has also begun in related subfields since 2010. We have observed that design metrics is still the most favored option to capture the characteristics of any given software before deploying it further in prediction model for determining the corresponding software maintainability. A significant increase in the use of public dataset for making the prediction models has also been observed and in this regard two public datasets User Interface Management System (UIMS) and Quality Evaluation System (QUES) proposed by Li and Henry is quite popular among researchers. Although machine learning algorithms are still the most popular methods, however, we suggest that researchers working on software maintainability area should experiment on the use of open source datasets with hybrid algorithms. In this regard, more empirical studies are also required to be conducted on a large number of datasets so that a generalized theory could be made. The current paper will be beneficial for practitioners, researchers and developers as they can use these models and metrics for creating benchmark and standards. Findings of this extensive review would also be useful for novices in the field of software maintainability as it not only provides explicit definitions, but also lays a foundation for further research by providing a quick link to all important studies in the said field. Finally, this study also compiles current trends, emerging sub-fields and identifies various opportunities of future research in the field of software maintainability.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3606095,The Omaha System: A systematic review of the recent literature,"Background The Omaha System (OS) is one of the oldest of the American Nurses Association recognized standardized terminologies describing and measuring the impact of healthcare services. This systematic review presents the state of science on the use of the OS in practice, research, and education. Aims (1) To identify, describe and evaluate the publications on the OS between 2004 and 2011, (2) to identify major trends in the use of the OS in research, practice, and education, and (3) to suggest areas for future research. Methods Systematic search in the largest online healthcare databases (PUBMED, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, Ovid) from 2004 to 2011. Methodological quality of the reviewed research studies was evaluated. Results 56 publications on the OS were identified and analyzed. The methodological quality of the reviewed research studies was relatively high. Over time, publications' focus shifted from describing clients' problems toward outcomes research. There was an increasing application of advanced statistical methods and a significant portion of authors focused on classification and interoperability research. There was an increasing body of international literature on the OS. Little research focused on the theoretical aspects of the OS, the effective use of the OS in education, or cultural adaptations of the OS outside the USA. Conclusions The OS has a high potential to provide meaningful and high quality information about complex healthcare services. Further research on the OS should focus on its applicability in healthcare education, theoretical underpinnings and international validity. Researchers analyzing the OS data should address how they attempted to mitigate the effects of missing data in analyzing their results and clearly present the limitations of their studies.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3606819,Randomised clinical trials on acupuncture in the Korean literature: bibliometric analysis and methodological quality.,"Acupuncture systematic reviewers have increasingly searched Chinese databases and journals to identify eligible randomised clinical trials (RCTs). However, reviewers have infrequently searched for eligible RCTs in Korean databases and journals. This study aimed to identify difficult to locate acupuncture RCTs in Korean databases and journals and to assess the characteristics and quality of the identified RCTs. Eleven electronic databases and seven journals were searched up to December 2012. All RCTs using needle acupuncture were considered for inclusion. Key study characteristics were extracted and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. One hundred and forty-three publications met our inclusion criteria. Acupuncture RCTs in the Korean literature emerged in the mid-1990s and increased in the mid-2000s. Diverse methods of acupuncture were used, including some methods unique to Korea (eg, Saam acupuncture). The largest proportion of trials evaluated acupuncture for musculoskeletal conditions (27.3%). The mean sample size was 44.3±25.3 per trial. Random sequence generation methods were reported in 44.8% of the RCTs, whereas only 11.9% reported methods of allocation concealment. A low proportion of trials reported participant blinding (32.9%) and outcome assessment blinding (18.9%). Korean acupuncture trials, many of which evaluate acupuncture styles unique to Korea, are typically omitted from systematic reviews of acupuncture, resulting in the potential for language bias. The development of this database of difficult to locate Korean trials, which includes English language translations of abstracts, will enable these trials of varying quality to be assessed for inclusion in future acupuncture systematic reviews.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

642235,Differential pricing of pharmaceuticals: A bibliometric review of the literature,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to perform a bibliometric review of the literature related to differential pricing of pharmaceuticals. Methods: A bibliometric literature review was performed with a particular focus on 'differential pricing and medicines'. Six hundred and thirty relevant articles were found, and 56 studies and documents matched the criteria for further screening. Thirty-eight articles were included in the final analysis. Key findings: The literature suggests that there are conflicting views regarding differential pricing. It has been difficult to implement differential pricing for medicines, and it has not been tried for most of the medicines. However, for products such as vaccines, drugs for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malaria and tuberculosis, differential pricing has been applied resulting in improved access to medicines. Also, there are questions as to how fair and affordable the differential prices are, and more research is needed regarding internal market segmentation and private and public distribution channels. Differential pricing is only feasible for 'global' diseases, whereby drugs have a rich country market to recoup research and development costs - there is no solution for 'neglected' diseases. Also, differential prices rely on pharmaceutical industry, and it does not encourage sustainability or autonomy in developing countries. Conclusion: Differential pricing is not a panacea for all pricing issues, but it should be recognised as one of the solutions to improve the access to medicines worldwide. Further research is required regarding how a systematic differential pricing scheme, inclusive of all countries and all pharmaceuticals, can be achieved. © 2014 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3606926,Comparison of outcomes and other variables between conference abstracts and subsequent peer-reviewed papers involving pre-harvest or abattoir-level interventions against foodborne pathogens,"Accuracy in the reporting of studies in conference abstracts is important because the majority of studies in such abstracts are never further detailed in peer-reviewed publications, and data from such abstracts may be used in systematic reviews. Previous research on interventional studies in human biomedicine indicates that there is no guarantee of consistency between a conference abstract and paper in the reporting of results and other key variables. However, no research has been done to determine if this lack of reporting consistency in abstracts and papers extends to interventional studies in pre-harvest/harvest-level food safety. The goal of this study was to compare outcome results and other key variables between conference abstracts and subsequent peer-reviewed publications describing studies of pre-harvest and abattoir-level interventions against foodborne pathogens, and to determine whether the agreement in the results or key variables was associated with the time to full publication. A systematic search identified 59 conference abstracts with matching peer-reviewed papers (matches), and data on variables including outcome measures and results, pathogens, species, interventions, overall efficacy of intervention, sample size and housing were extracted from both the conference abstracts and the papers. The matching of variables between abstracts and papers was described, and logistic regression used to test for associations between variable matching and time to publication. Sample size was only provided for both abstract and paper in 24 matches; the same sample size was reported in 20 of these matches. Most other variables were reported in the majority of abstracts/papers, and with the exception of outcomes and intervention effect, the reporting of variables was relatively consistent. There was no significant difference in the numbers of authors, with the first author the same in 78.3% of matches. Of 231 outcome measures reported in both abstracts and papers, nearly one third (77% or 32.2%) had different results, with 32 changing direction of effect. More than a quarter of matches involved at least one significant change in outcome result. The overall conclusion on the efficacy of the intervention changed in 10.7% of matches. There was a significant association between increased time to publication and differences in the number of authors, and having fewer outcome measures in the abstract reported in the paper. These results suggest that data from conference abstracts should be considered with caution. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic review,"Since its introduction in 1999, the term aggressive periodontitis (AgP) has been the topic of many investigations. Articles supporting the International Workshop for a Classification of Periodontal Diseases list several disease features, but do not offer operational criteria for identifying cases. Consequently, considerable variation in the understanding of AgP can be anticipated. Aim: To systematically assess the definitions of AgP reported in original periodontal research. Methods: A systematic review of original research on AgP published in English. Results: The electronic search yielded 833 abstracts. Of these, 472 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were appraised. In 26.5% of the publications, no information on AgP operationalization is presented, but reference is made to another article. In 12.7% of the publications, no information is provided as to how the cases were defined. Many combinations of criteria for case definition were found. Conclusions: This study revealed significant heterogeneity in the understanding and use of the term AgP in original research and poor documentation of the identification of cases. The direction and magnitude of the influence of misclassification and selection bias are unknown, but ought to be considered by the critical reader, professionals and patients using this term. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The goal of this paper is to survey researches conducted on the MapReduce framework in the context of its open-source implementation, Hadoop, in order to summarize and report the wide topic area at the infrastructure level. We managed to do a systematic review based on the prevalent topics dealing with MapReduce in seven areas: (1) performance; (2) job/task scheduling; (3) load balancing; (4) resource provisioning; (5) fault tolerance in terms of availability and reliability; (6) security; and (7) energy efficiency. We run our study by doing a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the research publications' trend which is published between January 1, 2014, and November 1, 2017. Since the MapReduce is a challenge-prone area for researchers who fall off to work and extend with, this work is a useful guideline for getting feedback and starting research.",2,2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1256644,When healthcare professionals cannot do the right thing: A systematic review of moral distress and its correlates,"Moral distress occurs when professionals cannot carry out what they believe to be ethically appropriate actions. This review describes the publication trend on moral distress and explores its relationships with other constructs. A bibliometric analysis revealed that since 1984, 239 articles were published, with an increase after 2011. Most of them (71%) focused on nursing. Of the 239 articles, 17 empirical studies were systematically analyzed. Moral distress correlated with organizational environment (poor ethical climate and collaboration), professional attitudes (low work satisfaction and engagement), and psychological characteristics (low psychological empowerment and autonomy). Findings revealed that moral distress negatively affects clinicians' wellbeing and job retention. Further studies should investigate protective psychological factors to develop preventive interventions.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3591876,Systematic review of blood transcriptome profiling in neuropsychiatric disorders: guidelines for biomarker discovery,"IntroductionThe utility of blood for genome-wide gene expression profiling and biomarker discovery has received much attention in patients diagnosed with major neuropsychiatric disorders. While numerous studies have been conducted, statistical rigor and clarity in terms of blood-based biomarker discovery, validation, and testing are needed. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of the literature to investigate methodological approaches and to assess the value of blood transcriptome profiling in research on mental disorders. We were particularly interested in statistical considerations related to machine learning, gene network analyses, and convergence across different disorders. ResultsA total of 108 peripheral blood transcriptome studies across 15 disorders were surveyed: 25 studies used a variety of machine learning techniques to assess putative clinical viability of the candidate biomarkers; 11 leveraged a higher-order systems-level perspective to identify gene module-based biomarkers; and nine performed analyses across two or more neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Notably, similar to 50% of the surveyed studies included fewer than 50 samples (cases and controls), while similar to 75% included less than 100. ConclusionsDetailed consideration of statistical analysis in the early stages of experimental planning is critical to ensure blood-based biomarker discovery and validation. Statistical guidelines are presented to enhance implementation and reproducibility of machine learning and gene network analyses across independent studies. Future studies capitalizing on larger sample sizes and emerging next-generation technologies set the stage for moving the field forwards.

3606449,"Historical bibliometric analysis of the top cited articles on vesicoureteral reflux 1950–2016, and incorporation of a novel impact index","Introduction and objectives: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been one of the defining conditions unique to pediatric urology since its inception. The clinical implications of this disease process depend on intrinsic patient factors such as age, genetics, epigenetics, voiding habits, anatomic anomalies, and extrinsic factors such as the pathogenicity of infectious agents. Knowledge about its natural history, the implications of conservative and surgical management, and their associated outcomes have evolved dramatically over time. This study aimed to use bibliometric analyses to summarize the evolution of VUR management over time. In order to accomplish this, the most referenced articles for VUR since 1950 were identified, and a comprehensive analysis of their impact on the management and understanding of VUR was performed by creating a novel impact index. Methods: A reference search was carried out for indexed citations through the portal ‘Science Citation Index’ in the subsection ‘Web of Science Core Collection’ using ‘vesicoureteral reflux’ as a MeSH term. References were analyzed and subcategorized according to various subtopics. A unique impact index was developed to adjust the number of publications for the time since publication, in order to define the impact of the paper amongst the most frequently cited papers. Articles were analyzed and data were tabulated according to the number of citations, country and institute of origin, journal of publication, impact factor, and first authorship. Results: Citation counts ranged from 43 to 510, and the mean number of citations per publication was 101.43. The most discussed topic was ‘treatment’. The impact index showed that more recent publications have a higher impact. The author with the highest index impact had 271 citations in a period of 5 years. The top 150 articles were published across 23 countries, the majority being from the USA (Summary fig.). The most frequently cited institution had 12 publications. The journal with the highest publication referencing rate was the Journal of Urology. Conclusion: The most cited articles were valuable sources of information to describe the historical evolution of the pathophysiology and management of VUR. After adjusting for time since publication, the most recent publications (i.e. those published after 1990) had a higher impact index. Combining traditional bibliometric analysis with this novel impact index may allow researchers to optimize future literature analyses, while also assisting clinicians in understanding best practices for patient management based on the available literature.[Figure presented] © 2018",1,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3593168,Optimization of infobutton design and Implementation: A systematic review,"Objective: Infobuttons are clinical decision tools embedded in the electronic health record that attempt to link clinical data with context sensitive knowledge resources. We systematically reviewed technical approaches that contribute to improved infobutton design, implementation and functionality. Methods: We searched databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database from inception to March 1, 2016 for studies describing the use of infobuttons. We selected full review comparative studies, usability studies, and qualitative studies examining infobutton design and implementation. We abstracted usability measures such as user satisfaction, impact, and efficiency, as well as prediction accuracy of infobutton content retrieval algorithms and infobutton adoption/interoperability. Results: We found 82 original research studies on infobuttons. Twelve studies met criteria for detailed abstraction. These studies investigated infobutton interoperability (1 study); tools to help tailor infobutton functionality (1 study); interventions to improve user experience (7 studies); and interventions to improve content retrieval by improving prediction of relevant knowledge resources and information needs (3 studies). In-depth interviews with implementers showed the Health Level Seven (HL7) Infobutton standard to be simple and easy to implement. A usability study demonstrated the feasibility of a tool to help medical librarians tailor infobutton functionality. User experience studies showed that access to resources with which users are familiar increased user satisfaction ratings; and that links to specific subsections of drug monographs increased information seeking efficiency. However, none of the user experience improvements led to increased usage uptake. Recommender systems based on machine learning algorithms outperformed hand-crafted rules in the prediction of relevant resources and clinicians' information needs in a laboratory setting, but no studies were found using these techniques in clinical settings. Improved content indexing in one study led to improved content retrieval across three health care organizations. Conclusion: Best practice technical approaches to ensure optimal infobutton functionality, design and implementation remain understudied. The HL7 Infobutton standard has supported wide adoption of infobutton functionality among clinical information systems and knowledge resources. Limited evidence supports infobutton enhancements such as links to specific subtopics, configuration of optimal resources for specific tasks and users, and improved indexing and content coverage. Further research is needed to Investigate user experience improvements to increase infobutton use and effectiveness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3606454,Presentations at 29 conferences of the spanish society of emergency medicine (Semes) from 1988 to 2017: A descriptive analysis,"Objective. To gain greater understanding of the development of emergency medicine in Spain by analyzing the presentations at conferences of the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine (SEMES) over the past 30 years (1988–2017). Methods. We examined the programs of all SEMES conferences and described the characteristics of both presentations and presenters. We also analyzed changes occurring between 1988 and 2017 of some of the characteristics observed. The Web of Science was searched to evaluate the scientific productivity of the most frequent presenters and to calculate h-indexes for those presenters to assesstheir scientific relevance. Results. SEMES did not hold a conference in 1992. The total of 29 conferences included 2182 presentations (112 listing presenters from abroad) given by 1410 presenters (89 from abroad). The presenters’ affiliations named 616 centers. The number of presentations and presenters increased linearly during the first period and then leveled off. The number increased exponentially in the final phase. Men gave 79.6% of the presentations; 70.6% of the presenters were physicians, 11.9% were nurses and 4.0% were ambulance staff. Specialists in emergency medicine accounted for 60.8% of the presenters who were physicians. Presenters from the Spanish autonomous community organizing the conference gave 29.8% of the presentations. The contributions of presenters from the local organizing community were nearly always more numerous than the average number of contributions from that community in all 29 conferences overall. Conference contributions from some autonomous communities (Extremadura, Andalusia, and Catalonia) were considerably fewer than would be expected given the scientific productivity of those communities. However, communities (Murcia, Balearic Islands, Asturias, Castile-Leon, Madrid), gave many more presentations than their productivity metrics would predict. Analysis of the 59 most frequent presenters (at 5 conferences or more) showed that 64.4% of them had published at least 20 articles and that 71.2% had an h-index of 5 or higher. The number of women on the program increased significantly between 1988 and 2017. Likewise, geographic diversity increased significantly (presentations from centers outside the local organizing area) as did the participation of hospital-based emergency medicine specialists. Conclusions. SEMES conference programs have attracted significantly more presentations and presenters over the years. We also detected changes in descriptive characteristics. The analysis of those characteristics can help future SEMES conference planners to plan ways to correct aspects such as scarce geographic diversity, low international participation, and few women among presenters. © 2018, Saned.

3605832,QoS-Aware Autonomic Resource Management in Cloud Computing: A Systematic Review,"As computing infrastructure expands, resource management in a large, heterogeneous, and distributed environment becomes a challenging task. In a cloud environment, with uncertainty and dispersion of resources, one encounters problems of allocation of resources, which is caused by things such as heterogeneity, dynamism, and failures. Unfortunately, existing resource management techniques, frameworks, and mechanisms are insufficient to handle these environments, applications, and resource behaviors. To provide efficient performance of workloads and applications, the aforementioned characteristics should be addressed effectively. This research depicts a broad methodical literature analysis of autonomic resource management in the area of the cloud in general and QoS (Quality of Service)-aware autonomic resource management specifically. The current status of autonomic resource management in cloud computing is distributed into various categories. Methodical analysis of autonomic resource management in cloud computing and its techniques are described as developed by various industry and academic groups. Further, taxonomy of autonomic resource management in the cloud has been presented. This research work will help researchers find the important characteristics of autonomic resource management and will also help to select the most suitable technique for autonomic resource management in a specific application along with significant future research directions.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3605497,Twenty years of research on political discourse: A systematic review and directions for future research,"There is a long tradition of linguistic research on political discourse, but little attention has been paid to what the concept of political discourse itself encompasses. With this in mind, this article aims to understand what types of discourse are categorized as 'political' in linguistic research and what their characteristics are (form, type of actors, policy domains, geographical coverage). To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of 164 scientific articles from the Scopus database. Overall, the findings show that political discourse is generally limited to the discourses of (institutionalized) political elites and most specifically to oral monological speeches. The review also highlights discrepancies regarding the geographical scope and the policy domains covered by the empirical analyses, more specifically a bias toward the Western world and issues related to external defense policies, justice and home affairs.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3606675,Citations for randomized controlled trials in sepsis literature: The halo effect caused by journal impact factor,"Citations for randomized controlled trials (RCT) are important for the dissemination of study results. However, predictors of citations for RCTs have not been investigated. The study aimed to investigate the predictors of citations for RCTs in sepsis literature. RCTs that investigated the efficacy of treatment strategies on clinical outcomes in sepsis patients were included, and publication dates were restricted to the period from 2000 to 2016. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews and interventions. A multivariable linear regression model was built to investigate the independent variables associated with total citations. In total, 160 RCTs met our inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. The median of total citations was 28.5 (IQR: 6-76). The journal impact factor (IF) for articles was 6.312 (IQR: 3.143-7.214). The dependent variable was transformed by the square root to improve normality and meet the assumption of homoscedasticity. The journal IF (coefficient: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.25) was independently associated with total citations. Large samples were associated with more total citations (coefficient: 0.0026; 95% CI: 0.0013, 0.0039). The study demonstrated that the journal IF was a major determinant of the RCT's total citation number. © 2017 Zhang, Poucke.

3594673,"Immunotoxicology: A brief history, current status and strategies for future immunotoxicity assessment","The discipline of immunotoxicology had its origins in the early 1970s, following the recognition of altered immune function and increased sensitivity to infections and cancers after exposure to environmental chemicals and therapeutic drugs. Reduced resistance to infectious disease was a well-documented consequence of primary and acquired immunodeficiencies, but a novel finding following xenobiotic exposure. The awareness of the consequences of altered immune function was likely heightened by the HIV epidemic, leading some to inappropriately characterize xenobiotic-induced immunosuppression as “chemical AIDS”, although it is now clear that mild to moderate suppression is the most likely outcome of inadvertent exposure. The human health implications of studies in which chemical exposure reduced resistance to infection, drove an early focus on immunosuppression within the toxicology community. Allergic hypersensitivity was well known to clinicians and symptoms were readily apparent, and therefore was not the initial focus of the developing toxicology subspecialty of immunotoxicology. The first review in the field of immunotoxicology was published by Vos in 1977, and, as research expanded during the years that followed, many of the assays, methodologies and approaches that are currently used to identify potential immunotoxicants were developed. Over the years, advances in our understanding of basic immunology have made it clear that allergy, immunosuppression and, in some cases, autoimmunity, are a matter of polarization of the immune response by immunotoxicants, rather than independent outcomes of chemical exposure. © 2017",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3606912,Magnitude of effects in clinical trials published in high-impact general medical journals,"Background: Prestigious journals select for publication studies that are considered most important and informative. We aimed to examine whether high-impact general (HIG) medical journals systematically demonstrate more favourable results for experimental interventions compared with the rest of the literature. Methods: We scrutinized systematic reviews of the Cochrane Database (Issue 4, 2009) and meta-analyses published in four general journals (2008-09). Eligible articles included ≥1 binary outcome meta-analysis(es) pertaining to effectiveness with ≥1 clinical trial(s) published in NEJM, JAMA or Lancet. Effect sizes in trials from NEJM, JAMA or Lancet were compared with those from other trials in the same meta-analyses by deriving summary relative odds ratios (sRORs). Additional analyses examined separately early- and late-published trials in HIG journals and journal-specific effects. Results: A total of 79 meta-analyses including 1043 clinical trials were analysed. Trials in HIG journals had similar effects to trials in other journals, when there was large-scale evidence, but showed more favourable results for experimental interventions when they were small. When HIG trials had less than 40 events, the sROR was 1.64 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.23-2.18). The difference was most prominent when small early trials published in HIG journals were compared with subsequent trials [sROR 2.68 (95% CI: 1.33-5.38)]. Late-published HIG trials showed no consistent inflation of effects. The patterns did not differ beyond chance between NEJM, JAMA or Lancet. Conclusions: Small trials published in the most prestigious journals show more favourable effects for experimental interventions, and this is most prominent for early-published trials in such journals. No effect inflation is seen for large trials. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association © The Author 2011; all rights reserved.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A bibliometric analysis was conducted with systematic search methods used to locate HIV/AIDS research publications (period of 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2011; search databases: MEDLINE (Ovid, PubMed), EMBASE, ISI-Thomson Web of Science; no language restrictions). The publication rate (number of HIV/AIDS research publications per million population in 10 years) and the rate of articles published in HIV/AIDS journals and selected journals with moderate to very high (IF ≥3) 5-year impact factors were used as markers for HIV research productivity. A negative binomial regression model was fitted to assess the impact of structural level factors (sociodemographic, health, HIV prevalence and research/development indicators) associated with the variation in HIV research productivity. Results: The total numbers of HIV/AIDS research publications in 2002.2011 by country ranged from 7 to 9128 (median 319). The median publication rate (per million population in 10 years) was 45 (range 5.150) for all publications. Across all countries, 16% of the HIV/AIDS research was published in HIV/AIDS journals and 7% in selected journals with IF ≥3. Indicators describing economic (gross domestic product), demographic (size of the population) and epidemiological (HIV prevalence) conditions as well as overall scientific activity (total research output) in a country were positively associated with HIV research productivity. Conclusions: HIV research productivity varies noticeably across EU countries, and this variation is associated with recognisable structural factors. © 2015 BMJ Open.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3605788,The h-Index of Editorial Board Members Correlates Positively With the Impact Factor of Sports Medicine Journals,"Background: The h-index is a metric widely used to present both the productivity and impact of an author's previous publications. Purpose: To evaluate and observe any correlations among the h-indices of 2015 editorial board members from 8 top sports medicine journals. Study Design: Systematic review. Methods: The sex, country of residence, degree, and faculty position of the editorial board members were identified using their respective scientific publication profiles. The h-index and other bibliometric indicators of these editorial board members were obtained using both the Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar (GS) databases. Nonparametric statistics were used to analyze differences in h-index values, and regression models were used to assess the ability of the editorial board member's h-index to predict their journal's impact factor (IF). Results: A total of 422 editorial board members were evaluated. The median h-index of all editors was 20 (interquartile range [IQR], 19) using GS and 15 (IQR, 15) using WoS. GS h-index values were 1.19 times higher than WoS, with significant correlation between these values (r(2) = 0.88, P = .0001). Editorial board members with a PhD had significantly higher h-indices than those without (GS, P = .0007; WoS, P = .0002), and full professors had higher h-indices than associate and assistant professors (GS, P = .0001; WoS, P = .0001). Overall, there were significant differences in the distribution of the GS (P < .0001) and WoS (P < .0001) h-indices of the editorial board members by 2014 IF of the journals. Both the GS h-index ( coefficient, 0.01228; 95% CI, 0.01035-0.01423; P < .0001) as well as the WoS h-index ( coefficient, 0.01507; 95% CI, 0.01265-0.01749; P < .0001) of editorial board members were significant predictors of the 2014 IF of their journal. Conclusion: The h-indices of editorial board members of top sports medicine journals are significant predictors of the IF of their respective journals.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3594676,Protein kinase CK2: Intricate relationships within regulatory cellular networks,"Protein kinase CK2 is a small family of protein kinases that has been implicated in an expanding array of biological processes. While it is widely accepted that CK2 is a regulatory participant in a multitude of fundamental cellular processes, CK2 is often considered to be a constitutively active enzyme which raises questions about how it can be a regulatory participant in intricately controlled cellular processes. To resolve this apparent paradox, we have performed a systematic analysis of the published literature using text mining as well as mining of proteomic databases together with computational assembly of networks that involve CK2. These analyses reinforce the notion that CK2 is involved in a broad variety of biological processes and also reveal an extensive interplay between CK2 phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications. The interplay between CK2 and other post-translational modifications suggests that CK2 does have intricate roles in orchestrating cellular events. In this respect, phosphorylation of specific substrates by CK2 could be regulated by other post-translational modifications and CK2 could also have roles in modulating other post-translational modifications. Collectively, these observations suggest that the actions of CK2 are precisely coordinated with other constituents of regulatory cellular networks. © 2017 by the authors.

Methods: Secondary data from a recent systematic literature review were analyzed. Bibliometric techniques included statistical analysis of publication counts and co-citation analysis. Findings were generated through calculations of frequencies of journals, authors, and articles published per year. Analysis was conducted for five policy-relevant domains: public place, schools, private space, workplace, and tobacco industry tactics. Results: Of the 5656 total articles examined, scientific articles written for the public place and workplace domains far outweighed those for schools, private spaces, and tobacco industry. This bibliometric analysis indicated that publication patterns aligned with patterns of policy activity and increasing sophistication in the evolution of smoke-free spaces policy development. This finding held for analyses by article, journal, and author over all years. The analysis also revealed relatively high numbers of unique authors publishing on smoke-free spaces policy each year. Conclusions: This study identified patterns regarding the publication of scientific articles, by varying journals and authors, and illustrated sub-field priorities both recently and for the entire 20-year period examined. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3595188,Life Cycle Cost Assessment of Electric Vehicles: A Review and Bibliometric Analysis,"The transportation sector has been reported as a key contributor to the emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. Hence, the need for the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) into the transportation sector. However, the competitiveness of the EVs with the conventional internal combustion engine vehicles has been a bone of contention. Life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) is an important tool that can be employed to determine the competitiveness of a product in its early stage of production. This review examines different published articles on LCCA of EVs using Scopus and Web of Science databases. The time trend of the published articles from 2001 to 2019 was examined. Moreover, the LCC obtained from the different models of EVs were compared. There was a growing interest in research on the LCC of EVs as indicated by the upward increase in the number of published articles. A variation in the LCC of the different EVs studied was observed to depend on several factors. Based on the LCC, EVs were found not yet competitive with conventional internal combustion engine cars due to the high cost of batteries. However, advancement in technologies with incentives could bring down the cost of EV batteries to make it competitive in the future.",1,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3606312,Designing security intelligent agent for petrol theft prevention,"Automotive industry has increased exponentially in recent years, and the number of car drivers has increased in the street as well, that lead to the increasing demand for using fuel stations. The increasing demand causes an increase of theft cases in the fuel stations particularly customers filling their cars and not paying for it. Although, there are several anti-petrol theft initiatives which include the use of Closed-Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) to recognize vehicle number plates or people's faces. However, the record shows that existing methods for detecting petrol theft are less ineffective and time-consuming as it has been delayed in detecting the offenders and it is not a good measure to deter offenders as it is weak to be precise on evidence/mapping features. In this paper, Media Access Control (MAC) address detection of mobile devices used for preventing the petrol theft. Mac addresses are extracted from the customer mobile devices to develop a framework that can prevent and detect petrol theft.

We analyze this information to detect errors, if any, in the matching process. As an example we also briefly discuss how publication sets formed by using UIDs as the match keys may affect the bibliometric indicators number of publications, number of citations, and the average number of citations per publication. The objective is addressed in a literature review and a case study. The literature review shows that only a few studies evaluate how well UIDs work as a match key. From the literature we identify four error types: Duplicate digital object identifiers (DOI), incorrect DOIs in reference lists and databases, DOIs not registered by the database where a bibliometric analysis is performed, and erroneous optical or special character recognition. The case study explores the use of UIDs in the integration between the databases Pure and SciVal. Specifically journal publications in English are matched between the two databases. We find all error types except erroneous optical or special character recognition in our publication sets. In particular the duplicate DOIs constitute a problem for the calculation of bibliometric indicators as both keeping the duplicates to improve the reliability of citation counts and deleting them to improve the reliability of publication counts will distort the calculation of average number of citations per publication. The use of UIDs as a match key in citation linking is implemented in many settings, and the availability of UIDs may become critical for the inclusion of a publication or a database in a bibliometric analysis. © 2016 Madsen HH et al.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3606956,An exploratory analysis of PubMed's free full-text limit on citation retrieval for clinical questions,"Objective: The research sought to determine (1) how use of the PubMed free full-text (FFT) limit affects citation retrieval and (2) how use of the FFT limit impacts the types of articles and levels of evidence retrieved. Methods: Four clinical questions based on a research agenda for physical therapy were searched in PubMed both with and without the use of the FFT limit. Retrieved citations were examined for relevancy to each question. Abstracts of relevant citations were reviewed to determine the types of articles and levels of evidence. Descriptive analysis was used to compare the total number of citations, number of relevant citations, types of articles, and levels of evidence both with and without the use of the FFT limit. Results: Across all 4 questions, the FFT limit reduced the number of citations to 11.1% of the total number of citations retrieved without the FFT limit. Additionally, high-quality evidence such as systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials were missed when the FFT limit was used. Conclusions: Health sciences librarians play a key role in educating users about the potential impact the FFT limit has on the number of citations, types of articles, and levels of evidence retrieved.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3590758,Use of metrics to quantify IMRT and VMAT treatment plan complexity: A systematic review and perspectives,"Purpose: Fixed-field intensity modulated radiation therapy (FF-IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) beams complexity is due to fluence fluctuation. Pre-treatment Quality Assurance (PTQA) failure could be linked to it. Several plan complexity metrics (PCM) have been published to quantify this complexity but in a heterogeneous formalism. This review proposes to gather different PCM and to discuss their eventual PTQA failure identifier abilities. Methods and materials: A systematic literature search and outcome extraction from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI) was performed. First, a list and a synthesis of available PCM is made in a homogeneous formalism. Second, main results relying on the link between PCM and PTQA results but also on other uses are listed. Results: A total of 163 studies were identified and n = 19 were selected after inclusion and exclusion criteria application. Difference is made between fluence and degree of freedom (DOF)-based PCM. Results about the PCM potential as PTQA failure identifier are described and synthesized. Others uses are also found in quality, big data, machine learning and audit procedure. Conclusions: A state of the art is made thanks to this homogeneous PCM classification. For now, PCM should be seen as a planning procedure quality indicator although PTQA failure identifier results are mitigated. However limited clinical use seems possible for some cases. Yet, addressing the general PTQA failure prediction case could be possible with the big data or machine learning help.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the proliferation of such research networks on long-term monitoring on many continents, little has been achieved in Africa. This study aims to assess and examine the spatiotemporal trend and categorical patterns in ecosystem monitoring-related research in Africa for the benefits of conserving biodiversity and sustaining natural resource sectors for well-being and livelihood security, environmental planning, and ecological stewardship. A systematic review was conducted using bibliometric tools. Based on a set of search terms and peer-reviewed publications retrieved from various ecosystem monitoring networks and journal databases, further analysis was conducted using social network approaches, mapping tools, and content analysis. About 1442 scientific publications on ecosystem monitoring and related research were documented from 1987 to 2014 mostly published in English. The number of publication increased progressively since 1992 after the Convention on Biodiversity was signed and this trend peaked till 2008. South African Journal of Science was the most leading journal and Nature the most cited. Internationally coauthored and collaborative articles represented majority of the findings with the United Kingdom at the central position in the research network due to colonial relationships. Regional collaboration amongst countries is limited owing to language barriers and other institutional constraints such as funding and short-term projects. These findings have implication for prioritizing national and regional policies toward biodiversity science and its contribution to human well-being, food security, and global change responses.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, scientific findings are not having an impact in terms of improvements or on educational policies. In this paper, our goals were to identify, organize, analyze and draw conclusions regarding Spanish academic performance in order to visualize the problems and identify areas for future research. This was carried out as a six-step procedure, in which methodological procedures using synthesis and bibliometric research were combined. Publications were identified in four Spanish databases; the data was then analyzed and coded under nine indicators: title, year, type of paper, publisher, author, number of authors, institution, region and topic. The results show steadily increasing production (1595 references), but disperse in terms of the huge number of published authors, most with a single paper, and of the places where they were published. The topics most widely addressed were explanatory models, diagnosis and treatment, followed by the factors and variables that determined the high or low academic achievement and, thirdly, studies of legislation and other performance-related psychological and educational variables. This study is a synthesis of production about academic performance in Spain and is a first step towards further synthesis research, to identify best practices for the exercise of ""evidence-based practices"", and other research problems.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3606100,Research articles on volunteering in biomedical journals: a MEDLINE-based bibliometric analysis,"Objective: Volunteering, an important aspect of society, is a multidisciplinary issue. However, there few are extensive surveys examining the trend and scope of research on volunteering in biomedical areas. Methods: Publications indexed with the Medical Subject Headings “volunteers” or “hospital volunteers” were downloaded from MEDLINE. We excluded publications indexed with “healthy volunteers” from the analysis. Results: A total 3555 research articles on volunteering were found in 1283 journals, through the end of 2016. The number of publications increased gradually from 1 article in 1953 to 254 articles in 2016. Only 51 journals had published 10 or more articles on this topic. Research articles on volunteering were published in journals with 110 specialties and were most often in journals related to public health, nursing, and health services. The largest proportion of articles was related to psychology. Although 10,853 authors were identified in 3555 articles, only eight authors have published more than 10 research articles on volunteering. Conclusion: Research interest in volunteering in biomedical areas has been growing in recent decades, but the total number of publications on volunteering remains relatively small. © The Author(s) 2020.",1,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3605553,Financial technology: a review of extant literature,"Purpose This paper aims to undertake a thematic review of academic papers on financial technology (FinTech) to identify three broad categories for the purpose of classifying extant literature. The paper summarizes the research and findings in this emerging field. Thereafter, it identifies the gaps and provides directions for further research. Simultaneously, the paper collates technical terms related to FinTech that appear repeatedly in each category and explains them. Finally, the study highlights the lessons that growing FinTech firms and their regulators can learn from the experiences of their counterparts across the globe. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of literature consisting of 130 studies (social science research network [SSRN]-29 papers, Scopus-81, other sources-20) on FinTech is carried out in this thematic paper. Findings This thematic paper divides FinTech into three themes, i.e. financial industry, innovation/technology and law/regulation. The paper suggests that a thorough impact of FinTech on various stakeholders can be understood using three dimensions, namely, consumers, market players and regulatory front. It is noted that FinTech is in its nascent phase and is undergoing continuous development and implementation through product and process innovation, disruption and transformation. Originality/value The paper is believed to add value to the understanding of FinTech in light of the emerging threats and opportunities for its various stakeholders.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3606288,Effectiveness of non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions for rheumatoid arthritis: an umbrella review,"OBJECTIVE: This umbrella review aimed to determine the effectiveness of non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions on the impact of rheumatoid arthritis. INTRODUCTION: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have identified seven major domains of the impact of disease: pain, functional disability, fatigue, sleep, coping, emotional well-being and physical well-being. This impact persists in many patients even after inflammatory remission is achieved, requiring the need for adjunctive interventions targeting the uncontrolled domains of disease impact. Several systematic reviews have addressed non-pharmacologic interventions, but there is still uncertainty about their effectiveness due to scarce or conflicting results or significant methodological flaws. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review included studies of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis in any context. Quantitative systematic reviews, with or without meta-analysis, that examined the effectiveness of non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions of any form, duration, frequency and intensity, alone or in combination with other interventions designed to reduce the impact of disease, were considered. The outcomes were pain, functional disability, fatigue, emotional well-being, sleep, coping, physical well-being and global impact of disease. METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy for 13 bibliometric databases and gray literature was developed. Critical appraisal of eight systematic reviews was conducted independently by two reviewers, using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for systematic reviews and research syntheses. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers using a standard Joanna Briggs Institute data extraction tool, and data were summarized using a tabular format with supporting text. RESULTS: Eight systematic reviews were included in this umbrella review, with a total of 91 randomized controlled trials and nine observational studies (6740 participants). Four systematic reviews examined the effects of multicomponent or single exercise/physical activity interventions, two examined the effects of hydrotherapy/balneotherapy, two examined the effects of psychosocial interventions, and one examined the effects of custom orthoses for the foot and ankle. Multicomponent or single exercise/physical activity interventions, psychosocial interventions and custom orthoses appeared to be effective in improving pain and functional disability. Fatigue also improved with the implementation of multicomponent or single exercise/physical activity interventions and psychosocial interventions. Only exercise/physical activity interventions appeared to be effective in reducing the global impact of disease and quality of life. None of the included systematic reviews reported on emotional well-being, sleep, coping or physical well-being as an outcome measure. Other types of interventions were not sufficiently studied, and their effectiveness is not yet established. CONCLUSIONS: Of the included interventions, only multicomponent or single exercise/physical activity interventions, psychosocial interventions and custom orthoses seem to reduce the impact of rheumatoid arthritis. Future evidence should be sought and synthesized in the domains identified as knowledge gaps, namely, emotional well-being, sleep, coping and physical well-being. Further examination of the effects of interventions that have not been assessed sufficiently is suggested in order to establish their effectiveness so decisions and recommendations can be made.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3606809,The jump in network ecology research between 1990 and 1991 is a Web of Science artefact,"Borrett et al. (2014) report a jump in network ecology publications between 1990 and 1991 but fail to find a cause for it. This jump in publication output is not a mystery, but a Web of Science artefact, due to the restriction of this database search to titles until 1990, whilst also abstracts and keywords are systematically searched in Web of Science starting from 1991. Indeed there is no such leap in publication numbers between 1990 and 1991 in Google Scholar. A sudden increase in publication numbers between the years 1990 and 1991 is instead found in Web of Science when searching for a variety of keywords. Until Web of Science allows researchers to consistently search for keywords within abstracts also before 1991, bibliometric research on publication growth rates using Web of Science should avoid comparing the number of publications retrieved before and after 1991. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3605732,"Characteristics, Trends, Quality of Systematic eview and meta-Analysis in General Radiology between 2007 and 2015","Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate the trends, characteristics, and quality of systematic review and meta-analysis in general radiology journals. Materials and Methods: We performed a PubMed search to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses that had been carried out in the field of radiology between 2007 and 2015. The following data were extracted: journal, impact factor, type of research, year of publication, radiological subspecialty, imaging modalities used, number of authors, affiliated department of the first and corresponding authors, presence of a radiologist and a statistician among the authors, discordance between the first and corresponding authors, funding, country of first author, methodological quality, methods used for quality assessment, and statistics. Results: Ultimately, we included 210 articles from nine general radiology journals. The European Journal of Radiology was the most common journal represented (47 of 210; 22.4%). Meta-analyses (n = 177; 84.3%) were published about five times more than systematic reviews without meta-analysis (n = 33; 15.7%). Radiology of the gastrointestinal tract was the most commonly represented subspecialty (n = 49, 23.3%). The first authors were most frequently located in China (n = 64; 30.3%). In terms of modality, magnetic resonance imaging was used most often (n =59; 28.1%). The number of authors tended to progressively increase over time, and the ratio of discordance between the first and corresponding authors also increased significantly, as did the proportion of research that has received funding from an external source. The mean AMSTAR assessment score improved over time (5.87/11 in 2007-2009, 7.11/11 in 2010-2012, and 7.49/11 in 2013-2015). In this regard, the journal Radiology had the highest score (7.59/11). Conclusions: The quantity and quality of radiological meta-analyses have significantly increased over the past 9 years; however, specific weak areas remain, providing the opportunity for quality improvement.",2,2,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3605843,Sex and STEM Occupation Predict Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) Scores in Half a Million People,"This study assesses Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores in a 'big data' sample collected through the UK Channel 4 television website, following the broadcasting of a medical education program. We examine correlations between the AQ and age, sex, occupation, and UK geographic region in 450,394 individuals. We predicted that age and geography would not be correlated with AQ, whilst sex and occupation would have a correlation. Mean AQ for the total sample score was m = 19.83 (SD = 8.71), slightly higher than a previous systematic review of 6,900 individuals in a non-clinical sample (mean of means = 16.94) This likely reflects that this big-data sample includes individuals with autism who in the systematic review score much higher (mean of means = 35.19). As predicted, sex and occupation differences were observed: on average, males (m = 21.55, SD = 8.82) scored higher than females (m = 18.95; SD = 8.52), and individuals working in a STEM career (m = 21.92, SD = 8.92) scored higher than individuals non-STEM careers (m = 18.92, SD = 8.48). Also as predicted, age and geographic region were not meaningfully correlated with AQ. These results support previous findings relating to sex and STEM careers in the largest set of individuals for which AQ scores have been reported and suggest the AQ is a useful self-report measure of autistic traits.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,

3605546,"A systematic review of mHealth funded R&D activities in EU: Trends, technologies and obstacles","Objective: This study provides a systematic review of EU-funded mHealth projects. Methods: The review was conducted based mainly on the Projects and Results service provided by the EU Open Data Portal. Even though the search strategy yielded a large number of results, only 45 projects finally met all the inclusion criteria. Results: The review results reveal useful information regarding mHealth solutions and trends that emerge nowadays in the EU, the diseases addressed, the level of adoption by users and providers, the technological approaches, the projects' structure, and the overall impact. New areas of application, like behavioral intervention approaches as well as an apparent trend towards affective computing, big data, cloud computing, open standards and platforms have also been recognized and recorded. Core legal issues with regard to data security and privacy still pose challenges to mHealth projects, while commercialization of the developed solutions is slow. Interdisciplinary consortia with the participation of a significant number of SMEs and public healthcare organizations are also key factors for a successful project. Conclusion: The study provides researchers and decision-makers with a complete and systematically organized knowledge base in order to plan new mHealth initiatives.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,

3606893,Research statistics in Atopic Eczema: What disease is this?,"Background: Atopic eczema is a common and distressing disease. This study aims to review PubMed indexed research statistics on atopic eczema over a-10 year period to investigate the clinical relevance and research interest about this disease. Methods: PubMed (a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine) was searched for the terms ""atopic dermatitis"" and ""eczema"", with limits activated (Humans, Clinical Trial, Meta-Analysis, Randomized Controlled Trial, English, published in the last 10 years), and editorials, letters, practice guidelines, reviews, and animal studies excluded. Journal impact factor (IF) is in accordance with Journal Citation Report (JCR) 2009, a product of Thomson ISI (Institute for Scientific Information). Results: A total of 890 articles were retrieved. Taking out publications that were irrelevant and those without an impact factor, 729 articles were obtained. These articles were grouped into dermatology (n = 337, mean IF: 3.01), allergy/immunology (n = 215, mean IF: 4.89), pediatrics (n = 118, mean IF: 2.53) and miscellaneous subject categories (n = 142, mean IF: 5.10). The impact factors were highest in the miscellaneous category (p = 0.0001), which includes such prestigious journals as the New England journal of Medicine (n = 1, IF: 47.05), the Lancet (n = 4, IF: 30.76) and BMJ (n = 6, IF: 13.66). There was no publication in any family medicine or general practice journal. The British Journal of Dermatology (n = 78), Pediatric Allergy and Immunology (n = 49) and Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (n = 46) had the highest number of publications on the subject. Atopic eczema ranked higher in impact factors in allergy/immunology although more publications appeared in the dermatology category. Conclusions: Atopic eczema is a multidisciplinary disease. Its clinical relevance and research interests are definitely beyond that of a mere cutaneous disease. Investigators may consider allergy/immunology and miscellaneous journal categories for higher impact of their research. © 2012 Hon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3606875,"Randomized trials in emergency medicine journals, 2008 to 2011","Study Objective: Knowledge of current areas of activity in emergency medicine research may improve collaboration among investigators and may help inform decisions about future research priorities. Randomized, controlled trials are a key component of research activity and an essential tool for improving care. We investigated the characteristics of randomized trials recently published in emergency medicine journals. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of randomized trials published in the 5 highest impact emergency medicine journals. PubMed was searched for reports of randomized trials involving human subjects indexed to MEDLINE between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2011. Included trials were classified with respect to study topic, funding source, presence of age-related inclusion criteria, and country of origin. Results: A total of 163 published studies were included for analysis. Pain management was the most commonly studied topic (n = 28, or 17%) followed by orthopedics (n = 24, or 15%), cardiovascular disease (n = 13, or 8%), and prehospital medicine (n = 13, or 8%). Less than half of studies received extramural funding support. Children were specifically examined in 22 (13%) of trials; only 5 trials (3%) specifically examined patients aged 60 or older.

Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsychInfo, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, and CINAHL for original studies related to ""palliative care"" and ""cancer"" during the first 6 months of 2004 and 2009. For each study, we extracted the study size, the sample size calculation, and other study characteristics. We also determined the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) overall quality score, the key methodologic index, and the Jadad score for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results A total of 840 studies were included for sample size analysis, and 44 RCTs were identified for quality of reporting analysis. The median sample size was 70 for RCTs, 112 for cohort studies, and 200 for cross-sectional studies. Sample size calculations were most frequently reported in RCTs; however, 29/44 (66%) RCTs had no reporting, 5/44 (11%) had partial reporting, and 10/44 (23%) had full reporting. The median CONSORT overall quality score was 9 (interquartile range 7-11), key methodologic index was 0.50 (interquartile range 0-1.75), and Jadad score was 2 (interquartile range 1-3), suggesting low quality of reporting. We found no differences in the quality scores between 2004 and 2009. Key methodologic index score ≥2 was associated with the presence of funding from any source (10/25 vs. 1/19, P=0.013) and funding from pharmaceutical industry (5/9 vs. 6/35, P=0.03).

310273,Research Trends in Evidence-Based Medicine: A Joinpoint Regression Analysis of More than 50 Years of Publication Data,"Background Evidence-based medicine (EBM) has developed as the dominant paradigm of assessment of evidence that is used in clinical practice. Since its development, EBM has been applied to integrate the best available research into diagnosis and treatment with the purpose of improving patient care. In the EBM era, a hierarchy of evidence has been proposed, including various types of research methods, such as meta-analysis (MA), systematic review (SRV), randomized controlled trial (RCT), case report (CR), practice guideline (PGL), and so on. Although there are numerous studies examining the impact and importance of specific cases of EBM in clinical practice, there is a lack of research quantitatively measuring publication trends in the growth and development of EBM. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis was constructed to determine the scientific productivity of EBM research over decades. Methods NCBI PubMed database was used to search, retrieve and classify publications according to research method and year of publication. Joinpoint regression analysis was undertaken to analyze trends in research productivity and the prevalence of individual research methods. Findings Analysis indicates that MA and SRV, which are classified as the highest ranking of evidence in the EBM, accounted for a relatively small but auspicious number of publications. For most research methods, the annual percent change (APC) indicates a consistent increase in publication frequency. MA, SRV and RCT show the highest rate of publication growth in the past twenty years. Only controlled clinical trials (CCT) shows a non-significant reduction in publications over the past ten years. Conclusions Higher quality research methods, such as MA, SRV and RCT, are showing continuous publication growth, which suggests an acknowledgement of the value of these methods. This study provides the first quantitative assessment of research method publication trends in EBM.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3594578,Computational methods for corpus callosum segmentation on MRI: A systematic literature review,"Background and objective: The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest white matter structure in the brain and has a significant role in central nervous system diseases. Its volume correlates with the severity and/or extent of neurodegenerative disease. Even though the CC's role has been extensively studied over the last decades, and different algorithms and methods have been published regarding CC segmentation and parcellation, no reviews or surveys covering such developments have been reported so far. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review of computational methods focusing on CC segmentation and parcellation acquired on magnetic resonance imaging. Methods: IEEExplore, PubMed, EBSCO Host, and Scopus database were searched with the following search terms: ((Segmentation OR Parcellation) AND (Corpus Callosum) AND (DTI OR MRI OR Diffusion Tensor Imag* OR Diffusion Tractography OR Magnetic Resonance Imag*)), resulting in 802 publications. Two reviewers independently evaluated all articles and 36 studies were selected through the systematic literature review process. Results: This work reviewed four main segmentation methods groups: model-based, region-based, thresholding, and machine learning; 32 different validity metrics were reported. Even though model-based techniques are the most recurrently used for the segmentation task (13 articles), machine learning approaches achieved better outcomes of 95% when analyzing mean values for segmentation and classification metrics results. Moreover, CC segmentation is better established in T1-weighted images, having more methods implemented and also being tested in larger datasets, compared with diffusion tensor images. Conclusions: The analyzed computational methods used to perform CC segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging have not yet overcome all presented challenges owing to metrics variability and lack of traceable materials. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3594785,Bioinformatic studies to predict microRNAs with the potential of uncoupling RECK expression from epithelial–mesenchymal transition in cancer cells,"RECK is downregulated in many tumors, and forced RECK expression in tumor cells often results in suppression of malignant phenotypes. Recent findings suggest that RECK is upregulated after epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in normal epithelium-derived cells but not in cancer cells. Since several microRNAs (miRs) are known to target RECK mRNA, we hypothesized that certain miR(s) may be involved in this suppression of RECK upregulation after EMT in cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we used three approaches: (1) text mining to find miRs relevant to EMT in cancer cells, (2) predicting miR targets using four algorithms, and (3) comparing miR-seq data and RECK mRNA data using a novel non-parametric method. These approaches identified the miR-183-96-182 cluster as a strong candidate. We also looked for transcription factors and signaling molecules that may promote cancer EMT, miR-183-96-182 upregulation, and RECK downregulation. Here we describe our methods, findings, and a testable hypothesis on how RECK expression could be regulated in cancer cells after EMT. © the authors.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,
3589721,Resource-Constrained Machine Learning for ADAS: A Systematic Review,"The advent of machine learning (ML) methods for the industry has opened new possibilities in the automotive domain, especially for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). These methods mainly focus on specific problems ranging from traffic sign and light recognition to pedestrian detection. In most cases, the computational resources and power budget found in ADAS systems are constrained while most machine learning methods are computationally intensive. The usual solution consists in adapting the ML models to comply with the memory and real-time (RT) requirements for inference. Some models are easily adapted to resource-constrained hardware, such as Support Vector Machines, while others, like Neural Networks, need more complex processes to fit into the desired hardware. The ADAS hardware (HW platforms) are diverse, from complex MPSoC CPUs down to classical MCUs, DPSs and application-specific FPGAs and ASICs or specific GPU platforms (such as the NVIDIA families Tegra or Jetson). Therefore, there is a tradeoff between the complexity of the ML model implemented and the selected platform that impacts the performance metrics: function results, energy consumption and speed (latency and throughput). In this paper, a survey in the form of systematic review is conducted to analyze the scope of the published research works that embed ML models into resource-constrained implementations for ADAS applications and what are the achievements regarding the ML performance, energy and speed trade-off.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,

3606917,The safety-influencing factors in use of the tonics of Chinese medicine: A meta-analysis based on the case reports in periodicals,"Objective: To identify the possible safety-influencing factors in use of the tonics of Chinese medicine. Methods: The related case reports published in periodicals published from 1949 to 2006 were analyzed with the bibliometrics method. Possibility on safety assessment of Chinese materia medica was discussed as well with the method of link analysis. Results: The total number of the tonics selected for the present study was 101, including 44 single drugs and 46 set prescriptions with adverse drug reactions (ADR) found in these tonics. It was found that ADR of 10 single drugs and 29 preparations were not specified in authoritative Chinese materia medica monographs. Among all the set prescriptions, the problem of injection has been standing on the top. Statistical analysis on single factor demonstrates that the most frequently referred ADR come from drug abuse (accounting for 29.20%), and overdose (24.54%). Conclusion: The safety problem of injection remains in a trend of robust growth at least for a period of time, thus reappraisal of the safety issue for the tonics of injection is imperative. It is essential for the public to take doctor's advice to guarantee safe administration of the tonics, especially for the patients with allergic constitution or those suffering from the liver and heart diseases.",1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3606824,Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS skin manifestation: Evidence-based thinking,"The latest global big data evidence indicated the changes of skin and venereal disease burden was huge. HIV/AIDS disease burden was the heaviest diseases among all skin and venereal diseases, and its skin manifestation was serious. The evidence of skin manifestation was searched and classified by subjects such as clinical symptoms, diagnosis & treatment, nursing, etc. The results showed, that the skin manifestation of HIV/AIDS with high incidence was serious, atypical, difficult to cure which was easy to misdiagnose or miss diagnosis. After analyzing the global HIV/AIDS guidelines, we found that many high quality guidelines with widely-covered subjects were produced by developed countries, while quite a few low quality and ones with narrowly-covered subjects were produced by developing countries. Only one guideline was for treatment of HIV/AIDS skin lesion. Based on the current evidence, we call for that all healthcare professionals to increase their awareness, update knowledge, and joint in cooperative prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. We also call for that we should produce high quality primary evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS skin manifestation, and clinical practice guidelines based on good evidence. For the increasing heavy burden of skin and venereal diseases, we should adjust and expand research directions, enrich and improve new interdisciplinary knowledge. We also should constantly train professionals and spread out knowledge in public on prevention and treatment for skin manifestation, so as to transform the evidence in time, effectively protect medical staff and susceptible population, effectively prevent and treat this disease, and improve the satisfaction of our country, hospitals and patients. © 2014 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,

3606005,The ethnopharmacological literature: An analysis of the scientific landscape,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: The research into bioactive natural products originating from medicinal plants, fungi and other organisms has a long history, accumulating abundant and diverse publications. However no quantitative literature analysis has been conducted so far. Aim of the study: Here we analyze the bibliometric data of ethnopharmacology literature and relate the semantic content to the publication and citation data so that the major research themes, contributors, and journals of different time periods could be identified and evaluated. Materials and methods: Web of Science (WoS) was searched to identify relevant publications. The Analyze function of WoS and bibliometric software (VOSviewer) were utilized to perform the analyses. Results: Until the end of November 2018, 59,576 publications -linked to ‘ethnopharmacology’ indexed by WoS, published since 1958 in more than 5600 journals, and contributed by over 20,600 institutions located in more than 200 countries/regions, were identified. The papers were published under four dominating WoS categories, namely pharmacology/pharmacy (34.4%), plant sciences (28.6%), medicinal chemistry (25.3%), and integrative complementary medicine (20.6%). India (14.6%) and China (13.2%) were dominating the publication space. The United States and Brazil also had more than 8.0% contribution each. The rest of the top ten countries/regions were mainly from Asia. There were around ten-fold more original articles (84.6%) than reviews (8.4%). Conclusions: Ethnopharmacological research has a consistent focus on food and plant sciences, (bio)chemistry, complementary medicine and pharmacology, with a more limited scientific acceptance in the socio-cultural sciences. Dynamic global contributions have been shifting from developed countries to economically and scientifically emerging countries in Asia, South America and the Middle East. Research on recording medicinal plant species used by traditional medicine continues, but the evaluation of specific properties or treatment effects of extracts and compounds has increased enormously. Moreover increasing attention is paid to some widely distributed natural products, such as curcumin, quercetin, and rutin. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",1,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
