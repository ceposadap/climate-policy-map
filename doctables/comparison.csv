738460,Offsetting benefits? Analyzing access to forest carbon,"Emissions trading has created new forms of exchangeable property which become commodities when traded in markets designed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and mitigate climate change. This paper analyzes a set of social processes which influence who benefits from reductions in emissions generated by primary production from forest ecosystems. Informed by commodification literature, and property and access theory, we suggest that farmers and rural communities cannot derive full benefits from carbon sequestration because they lack key structural and relational mechanisms, such as capital, knowledge, expertise, technology, and, in some cases, even labour. We illustrate this argument by examining three ongoing carbon-forestry projects in China, Ecuador, and Mexico and we highlight its implications for future forestry mitigation projects and programmes.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
40091,"An overview of the science-policy interface among climate change, biodiversity, and terrestrial land use for production landscapes","Global progress in addressing climate change through mitigation and adaptation has been slow, although policy tools are available and most countries now have some climate change policies. Climate change represents a tragedy of the commons caused by all humans, but one for which the damage is slow to accumulate and cannot be readily identified as coming from a single source. As a result, politicians are slow to act. The UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) has had minor achievements over 21 years, although the recent mitigation decision on REDD+ (reducing emissions from forest degradation and deforestation) recognizes the roles that eliminating deforestation and forest degradation and improving agriculture can play in mitigating climate change. The Cancun Agreement also states that, for mitigation to be effective, adaptation is needed. There is a strong body of literature linking biodiversity to ecosystem resilience and goods and services. Any policies dealing with mitigation and adaptation must consider the important role of biodiversity in terrestrial system recovery and management, including forests, agro-forests, and agricultural systems. In production landscapes, policies need to consider the large landscape scale and be cross-sectoral in application, including among forest, agriculture, transportation, energy, and human health sectors. Finally, local ecological knowledge and scientific information should form the basis for such policies.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1291618,"Effect of carbon tax on the industrial competitiveness of Chongqing, China","As one of the most cost-effective means of carbon emission reduction, carbon tax has attracted considerable attention from economists and international organizations. This study applied a two-region dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to discover how differentiated carbon taxes among regions would affect the competitiveness of local industries, taking an inland city-Chongqing in China-as an example. The results show that when carbon tax is implemented, it can effectively decrease carbon emissions and intensity, and achieve China's Nationally Determined Contribution target by 2030. It will, however, also have varied effects on the macroeconomy, with GDP losses of 1.54% to 2.5%. Meanwhile, industrial competitiveness in Chongqing will be affected heterogeneously. When Chongqing's tax level is higher than the rest of China, agriculture, textile, food, transport equipment, machinery, and electronics sectors will benefit from increased output activity. Meanwhile, paper, chemicals, nonmetal production, and metal smelting will suffer output losses. Such varied sectoral effects can be explained by two effects-price effect and scale effect-in three markets: domestic, interprovincial, and foreign. Finally, based on China's practical situation, this paper makes policy suggestions that could mitigate the negative effects of carbon tax. (C) 2018 International Energy Initiative.

187387,The liability rules under international GHG emissions trading,"Article 17 or the Kyoto Protocol authorizes emissions trading, but the rules governing emissions trading have been deferred to subsequent conferences. in designing and implementing an international greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading scheme, assigning liability rules has been considered to be one of the most challenging issues. In general, a seller-beware liability works well in a strong enforcement environment. In the Kyoto Protocol, however, it may not always work. By contrast, a buyer-beware liability could be an effective deterrent to non-compliance, but the costs of imposing it are expected to be very high. To strike a middle ground, we suggest a combination of preventive measures with strong but feasible end-of-period punishments to ensure compliance with the Kyoto emissions commitments. Such measures aim to maximize efficiency gains from emissions trading and at the same time, to minimize over-selling risks. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

219972,Avoiding bio-perversity from carbon sequestration solutions,"The development of a new carbon economy has the potential to offer winwin outcomes for environments and economies. Large-scale tree plantations are expected to play a major role in carbon economies but could have negative ecological and economic consequences when key environmental values such as biodiversity conservation are not considered. We discuss three potential bio-perversitiesnegative outcomes for biodiversitythat could result from inappropriate plantation tree programs aimed solely at reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide and mitigating rapid climate change effects. These are: (1) clearing native vegetation to establish tree plantations, (2) planting trees that become invasive taxa, and (3) tree plantations negatively affecting key ecosystem processes such as fire and hydrological regimes. These bio-perversities may result from common mistakes in environmental management: (1) too narrow a focus on a single environmental value, (2) failing to adequately quantify ecological uncertainty, and (3) failing to anticipate how different groups of people respond to an environmental problem. We highlight ways to prevent possible bio-perverse outcomes in large-scale plantation programs. These include requiring that risk assessments precede project establishment, full carbon accounting is undertaken, incentives used to stimulate tree plantation establishment are rigorously examined, and rigorous compliance and ecological monitoring is undertaken.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
777157,The Green Climate Fund as an effective compensatory mechanism in global climate negotiations,"The Paris Agreement reached during the COP21 in December 2015 represents a timid step towards burden sharing in emission mitigation involving all countries. However, given the heterogeneity of countries and their relative differences in vulnerability to climate change damage and in mitigation costs, compensating schemes are required to reach an effective agreement. This paper investigates the role of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as a potential compensating measure for both adaptation and mitigation actions under a global climate regime. A dynamic climate-economy computable general equilibrium model (GDynEP) is developed by including both a monetary valuation of climate change damage costs and two alternative methods to determine the allocation of GCF resources among receiving countries and between adaptation and mitigation contributions. Results show that, despite the high costs associated with the implementation of mitigation actions, most developing countries would face even higher costs in case of inaction. Furthermore, the preference of a country for an allocation method is strongly influenced by its characteristics and needs. Consequently, a main policy conclusion is to design country-specific sharing rules for GCF in order to maximize country participation in a global agreement.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
32357,Carbon Offsets and Inequality: Social Costs and Co-Benefits in Guatemala and Sri Lanka,"The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol is designed to reduce global CO(2) emissions while transferring technology and investment to developing countries. Little evaluation has been conducted, however, regarding the efficiency of outcomes and co-benefits or the social costs generated by carbon-mitigation projects. This article presents a comparative case study of two carbon-offset projects funded by fossil-fuel based power generation companies in the United States: the first forestry project funded explicitly to offset greenhouse gas emissions, in Guatemala, and the first rural solar electrification-carbon offset finance agreement, in Sri Lanka. We demonstrate that achieving offset targets and development-related benefits from CDM projects cannot be assumed, and that social equity can be negatively impacted by CDM-type projects. As such, future offset agreements and post-Kyoto climate negotiations would benefit from closer attention to issues of context, transparency, and social equity in order to minimize the social costs of carbon emissions trading.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
254719,Energy and climate hand-in-hand: Financing RES-E support with carbon revenues,"In Italy, the cost of support for renewable electricity (RES-E) is largely recovered through the ""A3 surcharge"", which weighs heavily on electricity bills. Using household survey data, we show the A3 surcharge is markedly regressive. Carbon taxation in the non-ETS sector is envisaged as a means to reduce CO2 emissions cost-effectively and generate revenue to lower the A3 surcharge. A non-ETS carbon tax would be less regressive than the A3 surcharge and its cost would be more evenly distributed across households. We calculate the revenue of a (sic)20/tCO(2) non-ETS carbon tax would have allowed a cut in the A3 surcharge of about 68% in 2011, and 39% in 2012. The impact of the carbon tax plus the reduced A3 surcharge would have been less regressive, but the cost higher for most households. The restrictions imposed in the simulations mean the results are only appropriate to render first-round effects of the reform. Policy relevance: In the vast majority of the EU Member States, the cost of RES-E support is largely paid by electricity consumers, most often through specific surcharges. Rising electricity prices are a common concern given the implications for competitiveness and equity. The Member States facing this issue could conveniently address it through environmental tax reforms consistent with the Climate and Energy Package. Replacing RES-E surcharges with carbon taxes in the non-ETS sector would permit cost-effective reduction of CO2 emissions while allocating the cost of RES-E support more equitably. The difference in regressivity would stem from the different consumption patterns of home fuels (including electricity) and motor fuels across income distribution. A cross-country comparison of energy household budget shares proves the structural nature of this difference between home fuels and motor fuels. Moreover, the notion that electricity consumers should pay for RES-E support is questioned on the grounds that electricity is a basic necessity good and RES-E support is a means of providing public goods, notably energy security and climate protection.

386176,What should we expect from innovation? A model-based assessment of the environmental and mitigation cost implications of climate-related R&D,"This paper addresses two basic issues related to technological innovation and climate stabilization objectives: can innovation policies be effective in stabilizing climate? To what extent can innovation policies complement carbon pricing (taxes or permit trading) and improve the economic efficiency of a mitigation policy package? To answer these questions, we use an integrated assessment model with multiple externalities and an endogenous representation of the technical progress in the energy sector. We evaluate a range of innovation policies, both as stand-alone and in combination with other mitigation policies. Our analysis indicates that innovation policies alone are unlikely to stabilize global concentration and temperature. As for the benefits of combining climate and innovation policies, we find efficiency gains of 10% (6 USD Trillions in net present value terms) for a stringent climate policy, and 30% (3 USD Trillions) for a milder one. However, such gains are reduced when more plausible (sub-optimal) global innovation policy arrangements are considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

1808191,Analysis of Government Regulation on China's Energy Management,"In recent years, China's steady and fast economic development has promoted energy production and consumption growth. In the circumstances of global warming and low carbon economy, our country is under the pressure of the energy market reform and energy saving and emission reduction, so effective energy management is critical. Though China has made energy management reforms for several times, there are still many problems in government regulation in the aspects of the concept, system, method, etc. In the increasingly fierce international energy competition, in order to solve the problem of energy management effectiveness, it is important to further improve the legal norms of government regulation, set up independent regulatory agencies to strengthen supervision, and integrated use scientific and effective regulation means such as price regulation, incentive measures and mandatory measures.",,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
184733,How do energy & environmental policy goals and instruments affect electricity demand? A framework for the analysis,"Several measures in the environment and energy realms are currently being implemented in the EU and its Member States. Three of these instruments, with an impact on the electricity market, are demand side management activities, promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources and measures aimed at the mitigation of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The objective of this paper is to analyse the impact of these energy efficiency and environmental goals and instruments on electricity demand and costs to electricity consumers when electricity markets are either national or international and when those policies are implemented by a national or an international institution. The paper shows that the effectiveness and impact of those measures largely depends on the demand response in the electricity market. An additional conclusion is that, when either the electricity markets or the support policies are national, distortions may occur, i.e. the reductions in electricity demand in one country may be subsidised by consumers or taxpayers in another country.

The comparison is made on the basis of two criteria: economic efficiency and cost effectiveness. If there were an accepted measure of the marginal benefit of reducing a ton of greenhouse gas emissions, a tax would clearly be advantageous from an efficiency perspective.

Moreover, I argue that, in social conflicts, the future of carbon markets is interpretively diverse with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas emission information, and greenhouse gas emission permits.

Empirical evidence is decidedly mixed. In this study, we use 19 years of monthly stock price returns, from 1991 to 2009, to examine the profitability of participation in CCX, a large voluntary greenhouse gas mitigation program. After controlling for systemic market risk as well as industry-specific shocks, we find statistically significant and positive excess returns for firms that announce their decision to join CCX. In addition, the progress of proposed greenhouse gas legislation (the Waxman-Markey bill) had a positive and large impact on excess returns for CCX member firms, suggesting that a major incentive for firms to join CCX may be to prepare for future regulation. Marginal abatement costs (proxied by the carbon price), on the other hand, were unrelated to excess returns.

While in the climate community eyes are set on the COP21 in Paris for a new climate policy framework which would succeed Kyoto, trade negotiators are preparing for the final phases of negotiations on so-called ""mega-regional"" trade agreements like the TPP, TTIP, and CETA. This paper argues that the current momentum should be harnessed to make trade policy part of the ""enabling environment"" for emission reductions. This would reflect worldwide economic trends with respect to growing markets for low-carbon technologies like renewable energy and energy-efficiency. However, it would also mean a new approach in the relationship between trade and the environment, and a shift of focus from regulatory space to common regulation and targeted trade-liberalization of climate-friendly goods and services.

561046,Assessment of the climate preparedness of 30 urban areas in the UK,"Cities are increasingly aware of the need to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to changes in weather patterns leading to the production of urban climate change plans. The few existing systematic studies of these plans have focused on either adaptation or mitigation issues, and are typically based on surveys completed by city officials rather than analysis of documented evidence. To gain insight into the status of adaptation and mitigation action across the UK, climate change documents from 30 urban areas (representing similar to 28 % of the UK's population) were analysed. An Urban Climate Change Preparedness Score, which could be applied to other urban areas outside the UK, has been devised for comparative analysis. This analysis characterizes progress against (i) Assessment, (ii) Planning, (iii) Action, and (iv) Monitoring, for both adaptation and mitigation. The Preparedness Score allows a quantitative comparison of climate change strategies across the urban areas analysed. This methodology can be transferred to other countries and makes an international comparison of urban areas and their climate change adaptation and mitigation plans possible. We found that all areas acknowledge climate change being a threat and that adaptation and mitigation planning and action is required. However, two urban areas did not have official adaptation or mitigation plans. Typically, mitigation activities across all cities were more advanced than adaptation plans. Emissions reduction targets ranged from 10 %-80 % with differing baselines, timeframes and scopes, for defining and meeting these targets. Similar variability was observed across adaptation plans. Several reasons for these differences are considered, but particularly notable is that a combination of incentives and regulation seem to stimulate more comprehensive strategies and action in many urban areas.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1818271,"OXY-FUEL GAS TURBINE, GAS GENERATOR AND REHEAT COMBUSTOR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION","Future fossil-fueled power generation systems will require carbon capture and sequestration to comply with government green house gas regulations. The three prime candidate technologies that capture carbon dioxide (CO(2)) are pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion techniques. Clean Energy Systems, Inc. (CES) has recently demonstrated oxy-fuel technology applicable to gas turbines, gas generators, and reheat combustors at their 50MW(th) research test facility located near Bakersfield, California. CES, in conjunction with Siemens Energy, Inc. and Florida Turbine Technologies, Inc. (FTT) have been working to develop and demonstrate turbomachinery systems that accommodate the inherent characteristics of oxy-fuel (O-F) working fluids. The team adopted an aggressive, but economical development approach to advance turbine technology towards early product realization; goals include incremental advances in power plant output and efficiency while minimizing capital costs and cost of electricity [1]. Proof-of-concept testing was completed via a 20MW(th) oxy-fuel combustor at CES's Kimberlina prototype power plant. Operability and performance limits were explored by burning a variety of fuels, including natural gas and (simulated) synthesis gas, over a wide range of conditions to generate a steam/CO(2) working fluid that was used to drive a turbo-generator. Successful demonstration led to the development cif first generation zero-emission power plants (ZEPP). Fabrication and preliminary testing of 1(st) generation. ZEPP equipment has been completed at Kimberlina power plant (KPP) including two main system components, a large combustor (170MW(th)) and a modified aeroderivative turbine (GE J79 turbine). Also, a reheat combustion system is being designed to improve plant efficiency. This will incorporate the combustion cans from the J79 engine, modified to accept the system's steam/CO(2) working fluid. A single-can reheat combustor has been designed and tested to verify the viability and performance of an O-F reheater can. After several successful tests of the generation equipment, development started on 2(nd) generation power plant systems. In this program, a Siemens SGT-900 gas turbine engine will be modified and utilized in a 200MW, power plant. Like the 1(st) generation system, the expander section of the engine will be used as an advanced intermediate pressure turbine and the can-annular combustor will be modified into a O-F reheat combustor. Design studies are being performed to define the modifications necessary to adapt the hardware to the thermal and structural demands of a steam/CO(2) drive gas including testing to characterize the materials behavior when exposed to the deleterious working environment. The results and challenges of 1(st) and 2(nd) generation oxy-fuel power plant system development are presented.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
667760,Proposal for a national inventory adjustment for trade in the presence of border carbon adjustment: Assessing carbon tax policy in Japan,"In this paper we pointed out a hidden inequality in accounting for trade-related emissions in the presence of border carbon adjustment. Under a domestic carbon pricing policy, producers pay for the carbon costs in exchange for the right to emit. Under border carbon adjustment, however, the exporting country pays for the carbon costs of their exports to the importing country but not be given any emission credits. As a result, export-related emissions will be remained in the national inventory of the exporting country based on the UNFCCC inventory approach. This hidden inequality is important to climate policy but has not yet been pointed out. To address this issue we propose a method of National Inventory Adjustment for Trade, by which export-related emissions will be deducted from the national inventory of the exporting country and added to the national inventory of the importing country which implements border carbon adjustment. To assess the policy impacts, we simulated a carbon tax policy with border tax adjustment for Japan using a multi-region computable general equilibrium model. The results indicate that with the National Inventory Adjustment for Trade, both Japan's national inventory and the carbon leakage effects of Japan's climate policy will be greatly different.

584830,Public acceptability of personal carbon trading and carbon tax,"Climate change is one of the greatest challenges confronting the international community requiring action to achieve deep cuts in carbon emissions. The implementation of potentially uncomfortable but necessary policy measures is, though, critically dependent upon public acceptability. This paper reports a novel application of stated preference techniques to explore the influence of key design attributes on the acceptability of a personal carbon trading scheme in isolation and when compared to a carbon tax. Illustrative forecasts from the models developed indicate the importance of design attributes, especially the basis of the initial permit allocation for personal carbon trading and the use to which revenues are put for carbon tax. Results indicate that the ""best"" scheme designs could be acceptable to a majority of respondents. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

648850,Fly Ash and Paper Sludge on the Evolution of Ternary Blended Cements: Mineralogy and Hydrated Phases,"Natural pozzolans are defined as either raw (volcanic material, limestone) or calcined natural materials (burnt shale, calcined kaolinite) with pozzolanic properties. Historically, they are among the oldest materials that have been used in combination with lime for construction purposes. For example, Santorin earth is a natural pozzolan from a volcanic eruption around 1500 BCE on an island of the same name in Greece. Over the last decades, research into cement matrices has been changing direction, owing to deeper environmental concerns over the impact of the cement industry and its consequences for climate change. Global environmental policies are increasingly strict, prioritizing the re-use rather than the disposal of industrial wastes. In this context, one of the biggest challenges is the search for strategies that promote the industrial rotation of high volumes of wastes in their productive cycles. The main purpose of this research is to widen the existing knowledge base on the behavior of new mineral pozzolans of high added value in the cement sector, lending special attention to paper sludge wastes generated in the process of paper manufacture, in which recycled paper is used as a raw material. The results to date show that, once thermally activated (in the range of 650-700 degrees C), paper sludge turns out to be an alternative source of recycled metakaolin. This product is characterized by its high pozzolanic activity and improved performance with regard to the benefits of certain binary cements. The possibility of incorporating this industrial waste in cements along with other already standard pozzolans focuses, as mentioned, on the notable increase in the production of these types of cements. This is due, at present, to the extensive constructive applications for type-II cements (single additive) and to their lower economic and energetic costs that also makes them more suitable in times of economic crisis. In the present paper, the influence that pozzolan blends (activated paper sludge and fly ash) have on the reaction kinetics of ternary blended cements (6 and 21% of replacement) is evaluated, paying special attention to the identification and evolution of hydrated phases with increasing reaction times. The results obtained represent a pioneering research line at a global level and represent a starting point for future investigations because in the case of using paper sludge, release of CO 2 from organic matter is very low and is listed as zero release.

64886,Designing payments for ecosystem services: Lessons from previous experience with incentive-based mechanisms,"Payments for ecosystem services (PIES) policies compensate individuals or communities for undertaking actions that increase the provision of ecosystem services such as water purification, flood mitigation, or carbon sequestration. PIES schemes rely on incentives to induce behavioral change and can thus be considered part of the broader class of incentive- or market-based mechanisms for environmental policy. By recognizing that PIES programs are incentive-based, policymakers can draw on insights from the substantial body of accumulated knowledge about this class of instruments. In particular, this article offers a set of lessons about how the environmental, socioeconomic, political, and dynamic context of a PIES policy is likely to interact with policy design to produce policy outcomes, including environmental effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and poverty alleviation.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The conferences of Rio de Janeiro, 1992, and Kyoto, 1997, originally focusing on environmental protection at both macro- and micro-economic levels, called for new economic instruments of this kind. An important economic tool in this area is Joint Implementation (JI), defined in Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol.

477369,An optimization approach for integrating planning and CO2 emission reduction in the petroleum refining industry,"The petroleum refining industry plays a very important role in international economics and in our daily life. The world refining capacity has increased rapidly during the past decade, and this makes operation planning, scheduling, and general optimization become important tools for the refinery industry. However, environmental regulations and risks of climate change are pressuring the refinery industry to minimize its greenhouse gas emissions. In this research, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed for the production planning of refinery processes to achieve maximum operational profit while reducing CO2 emissions to a given target through the use of different CO2 mitigation options. The options considered in this study are flow-rate balancing (decreasing the inlet flow rate to a unit that emits more CO2) fuel switching (changes in a certain operation to run with a different fuel that emits less CO2 emissions, such as natural gas), and installation of a CO2 capture process (e.g., the monoethanolamine (MEA) process). The objective of the MINLP model is to determine suitable CO2 mitigation options for a given reduction target while meeting the demand of each final product and its quality specifications, while simultaneously maximizing profit. In this study, a Global optimization algorithm is used on the different case studies considered.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
592552,Comparison of different climate regimes: the impact of broadening participation,"So-far, most climate mitigation studies look at climate policy strategies in a so-called first-best world, i.e. using the least expensive emission reduction options in all world regions and sectors. To explore the impact of limited participation of countries, we have run a set of scenarios that explore the impact of introducing a carbon tax in OECD, the BRIC countries (Brazil Russia, India and China) and the rest of the world. The results show that carbon taxes can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, if low greenhouse gas concentration levels are to be achieved, early participation (in some form) of large developing countries is important to increase reduction potential. It should be noted that global carbon taxes (without additional assumptions) lead to relatively high costs in low-income regions. Cap-and-trade regimes have more flexibility to create a comparable distribution of costs amongst countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

734508,How to Have Sustainable Transportation without Making People Drive Less or Give Up Suburban Living,"Motorized automobility and suburban living are not only highly valued but are also associated with a range of serious social problems, including deaths and injuries of motor-vehicle users and nonusers, roadway congestion, air pollution, dependence on insecure oil supplies, community fragmentation, and climate change. However, these problems, which make the present transportation and land-use system unsustainable, are not necessary consequences of automobility and suburban living per se, but rather are attributable mainly to the high kinetic energy of fast, heavy-motor vehicles (FHVs). Therefore, the challenge in creating a sustainable transportation and land-use system is to dramatically lower the kinetic energy of personal travel while retaining the advantages of personal motorized automobility and low-density development. Our approach is to redefine the technical artifact that is the conventional automobile and create two autonomous and universally accessible travel networks at a citywide scale: one for FHVs, the other for low-speed, low-mass modes including walking, cycling, and a new class of motor vehicles. In this paper, we motivate the need for this new urban-settlement and transportation-infrastructure scheme (USATIS), describe its design principles and features, review aspects of it in the literature and in the real world, present analyses covering a wide range of sustainability criteriasafety, mobility, congestion, environmental and energy-use impacts, urban aesthetics and community fragmentation, and economicsand discuss challenges for implementation and future research. We conclude that our USATIS does have the potential to support sustainable transportation without making people drive less or give up suburban living, but that before practical implementation plans can be considered, more research needs to be done on how people will adapt to the opportunities and constraints in the proposal.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1060286,Review of progress with integrated coastal management in South Africa since the advent of democracy,"Worldwide, coastal environments are recognised as complex systems of immense biophysical, socioeconomic and cultural value. In South Africa, the promulgation of the Coastal White Paper in 2000, and the Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) Act of 2008, signalled a significant paradigm shift in coastal management and governance. This article reports on progress with ICM in South Africa from 1994 to the present time, and draws on information gathered from a comprehensive review of the published ICM literature, as well as various technical reports, an online survey, and information gleaned from participation in various meetings and workshops. Here, we review the enabling legal and institutional framework for ICM in South Africa, examine the various programmes, plans, strategies and guidelines developed to support implementation of the ICM Act, discuss institutional developments, and reflect on preconditions for effective and sustained ICM implementation. Despite significant progress, key challenges to implementing this progressive ICM agenda include lack of political support, inadequate institutional capacity, lack of human and financial resources, uncertainty regarding ICM functions across different spheres of government, conflicting policy frameworks, lack of clarity regarding the application of ICM provisions on private and communal land, limited civil-society involvement in decision-making, and persistence of state-centric approaches. Issues requiring urgent action are the establishment of a National Coastal Committee with broad representation, revitalisation of public interest in the coast, declaration of coastal public property and coastal access land, improved cooperation across relevant government agencies, allocation of funds for ICM, and greater commitment to a more deliberative and collaborative style of governance.",1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

The paper provides a review of policies. The conclusions are as follows. (a) Investments in renewable energy should be helped by competition and regulatory reform in the energy industry, in the electricity industry in particular, since such reforms should reduce the subsidies, which historically have permeated the countries' industries, for electricity production from fossil and hydro resources. (b) The scope for further cost reductions is appreciable in all key technologies. There are positive externalities to investment, in the sense that each generation of investments is acting to reduce the costs of future generations; such benefits ideally need to be recognized in tax and regulatory policies and in budgetary allocations for research and development (R&D) and education and training. (c) The environmental advantages of renewable energy will become more apparent as developing countries begin to introduce their environmental policies on fossil fuels. The paper also evaluates the economists' recommendations for carbon taxes, which would favor renewable energy investments. The case for such taxes has been widely ignored by policy makers. The paper suggests that (d) a more workable and focused policy would be to accelerate the development of the ''renewable energy option''; this would be economically beneficial in itself and at the same time would reduce the uncertainties and costs of responding to the challenges posed by climate change.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
607725,Impact of CO2 cap-and-trade programs on restructured power markets with generation capacity investments,"A cap-and-trade program is the most widely discussed policy aimed at achieving CO2 emissions reductions. Since power plants in the US and other industrialized nations are responsible for a sizable portion of CO2 emissions, the implementation of a CO2 cap-and-trade program will have a significant impact on the power generation sector. Assessing this impact is a challenging task, especially in restructured electricity markets. Cap-and-trade programs consider multiple design parameters and attributes as well as the creation of a new market for CO2 allowances, all of which will affect the capacity investment decisions of generators and the bids that generators submit to the day-ahead and real-time electricity markets. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic model driven methodology to assess the impact of CO2 cap-and-trade programs in restructured electricity markets. The methodology is implemented on a sample power network created from the electricity market data of northern Illinois in the US. The network is assumed to operate under a CO2 cap-and-trade program similar to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The impact of cap-and-trade policy on the equilibrium generation expansion plan and the electricity market operation is examined via variations in prices, CO2 emissions, demand, and evolution of technology mix in the generation portfolio over a planning horizon.

There is no precedent for a global regime and only the USA has domestic experience. The USA would prefer minimal constraints on greenhouse gas trading. The EU would like rules guaranteeing that trading will be supplemental to domestic action and that countries are not able to transfer 'hot air', reducing the environmental effectiveness of the protocol. Agreeing trading rules is vital if the Kyoto Protocol is to enter into force. Emissions trading is compatible with a range of domestic policies and measures, but some form of cap and trade scheme is needed to make international trading possible.

The paper presents estimated achievements of MEES from 1990 to 2012 and future scenarios until 2030 by implementing stricter MEES based on the best technology available. A replacement technology model was developed to estimate, saved energy and avoided CO2 emissions for different appliances' lifetimes. Considering a 16-year average lifetime of appliances and 80% penetration of efficient lighting technologies, in 2013 energy savings were estimated to be 16.06-TWh (emission reduction of 9.5 Tg CO2).

565996,Social Justice and Adaptation in the UK,"Adaptation strategies and policies are normally based on climate impact assessments that fail to take account of the social nature and distribution of vulnerability to climate change. This is largely a product of the dominant assessment techniques that are used to inform such strategies and the limits of existing evidence. In this paper I contribute to filling gaps in the current adaptation literature by exploring the social nature of vulnerability and the potential for socially just adaptation. It does so by reviewing studies from the UK, in particular those under the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's Climate Change and Social Justice programme. It finds that vulnerability to high temperatures and fluvial and coastal flooding, in terms of sensitivity, exposure, and the capacity to anticipate, respond, and recover, is concentrated in certain disadvantaged and socially marginalized groups, including those on low incomes. It also finds that both autonomous and planned adaptation may fail to protect the most vulnerable individuals and groups, and may even reinforce existing patterns of vulnerability in some cases, i.e., mal-adaptation, especially where they rely on unmediated market forces or where they fail to explicitly recognize aspects of social vulnerability in their design and implementation. I argue that social justice should be an explicit objective of adaptation strategy.",3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
786534,How strong is public support for unilateral climate policy and what drives it?,"Conventional wisdom holds that climate change poses a global public goods problem, thus requiring a global solution that reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide through some form of centralized target setting and burden-sharing arrangement among countries. Yet, the 2015 Paris Agreement has essentially given up on this approach, on which the 1997 Kyoto Protocol was based, and now relies on policies that are adopted unilaterally and voluntarily by individual countries. Since ambitious climate policies are very unlikely to be enacted and effectively implemented without strong public support, research is beginning to explore how strong public support is for unilateral climate policy and what its determinants are. Recent research has developed useful survey instruments to gauge public support for unilateral climate policy. Results from surveys and survey-embedded experiments show that when respondents are confronted with cost implications and free-riding problems associated with unilateral climate policy, public support tends to drop to some extent, but still remains quite high. Current research thus shows that people are-the hitherto strong global public goods framing of climate policy not with standing-surprisingly nonreciprocal in their climate policy preferences. Preferences concerning climate policy tend to be driven primarily by a range of personal predispositions and cost considerations, which existing research has already explored quite extensively, rather than by considerations of what other countries do.

239426,Developing a complementary framework for urban ecology,"Cities are characterized by dynamic interactions between socio-economic and biophysical forces. Currently more than half of the global population reside in cities which influence the global biogeochemical cycles and climate change, substantially exacerbating pressures on urban pollution, water quality and food security, as well as operating costs for infrastructure development. Goods and services such as aesthetic values, water purification, nutrient recycling, and biological diversity, that urban ecosystems generate for the society, are critical to sustain. Urban planners are increasingly facing the considerable challenges of management issues for urban ecosystems. Poor understanding of the complementary roles of urban ecology in urban infrastructure, and the functioning of ecosystems and ecological resilience of a complex human-dominated landscape has impeded effective urban planning over time, resulting in social disharmony. Here a complementary framework for urban ecology is proposed, in which ecosystems interact with land use, architecture and urban design - ""E-LAUD""-affecting ecosystem and human health, and building on the concept that land uses in urban green areas, road-strips, wetlands, 'habitat islands' and urban architecture could synergistically benefit when clustered together in different combinations of urban landscapes. It is proposed that incorporation of the E-LAUD framework in urban planning forms the context of a new interdisciplinary research programme on ecological resilience for urban ecosystems and helps promote ecosystem services.

629593,"Monitoring trends of urban development and environmental impact of Beijing, 1999-2006","The high rates of environmental change and accelerated species loss in the urban development process should be quantified to rebalance the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. In this study, an emergy-based environmental impact assessment model is designed according to the framework of the Eco-Indicator 99 for monitoring the negative effects on human well-being and ecosystem integrity in the urban development system of Beijing from 1999 to 2006. The environmental impact assessment model is based on the sustainability promotion perspective, and emphasizes the determinants of human health and ecosystem integrity in the urban development process. It is vital that the links among human health, ecosystem integrity and urban sustainability are therefore considered especially from the perspective of a supply-side environmental cost evaluation (including ecological service supply, ecological and economic losses and investment for treatment). Results suggest that: (1) out of all the pollutants, ecological services were mainly used to dilute sulfur dioxide and NH3-N; (2) nitrogen dioxide and greenhouse gases released by the urban system contribute heavily to both ecological and economic losses evaluated in emergy terms; and (3) emissions impact, mainly from airborne pollutants, with small contribution from waterborne emissions, generally increases from 1999 to 2006, undermining the sustainability of Beijing. The emergy synthesis proves to be very appropriate to account for large-scale and indirect costs generated by pollution as side effects of economic activity. Such knowledge is a necessary pre-requisite to perform a reliable cost-benefit evaluation of urban sustainability strategies, and provide guidance for policy decision making to maximize benefits and minimize negative impacts.

427863,Redefining RECs - Part 2: Untangling certificates and emission markets,"Renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions markets are currently in a state of confusion regarding the treatment of Renewable Energy Certificate (RECs). How should emission-trading schemes treat RFCs? How can emission mitigation policies provide real incentives for renewable generation? The objective of REC markets should be to promote additional renewable energy investments. The author asserts that defining RECs in terms of attributes, especially off-site attributes, does not further this goal. Ambiguous language such as ""environmental attribute"" or ""environmental benefit"" creates confusion in the marketplace while failing to address the relevant coordination issues with Renewable Portfolio Standard compliance markets, voluntary emission offset markets, or emission cap-and-trade markets. Specifically, defining RECs in terms of off-site attributes creates a number of problems, including that once an emissions cap-and-trade scheme is in place, such definitions of a REC can become indefensible. The author proposes to redefine RECs in terms of on-site attributes, which resolves the aforementioned problems and allows compliance and voluntary renewable energy and emission markets to function without conflicts. Ideally, environmental commodities should be homogeneous, first best measures of the relevant environmental good, as well as easily measured and verified. The author proposes tradable environmental commodities that achieve these characteristics. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

762844,Carbon allowance auction design of China's emissions trading scheme: A multi-agent-based approach,"In this paper, a multi-agent-based ETS simulation model is proposed for carbon allowance auction design in China. In the proposed model, two main agents, i.e., the government (the ETS implementer) and the firms in different sectors (the ETS targets), are considered. Under the ETS policy, all agents make various decisions individually according to their own goals, and interact with each other through three main markets: the commodity market, the primary carbon auction market and the secondary carbon trading market. Different popular auction designs are introduced into the ETS formulation to offer helpful insights into China's ETS design. (1) Generally, the ETS would lead to positive effects on China's carbon mitigation and energy structure improvement, but a negative impact on economy. (2) As for auction forms, the uniform-price design is relatively moderate, while the discriminative-price design is quite aggressive in both economic damage and emissions reduction. (3) As for carbon price, the uniform-price auction might generate a slightly higher market clearing price than the discriminative-price auction, and the prices under two auction rules fluctuate about RMB 40 per metric ton. (4) As for carbon cap, the total allowances in the carbon auction market should be carefully set to well balance economic growth and mitigation effect.",,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
356639,Analysis of the EU policy package on climate change and renewables,"In 2009 the EU decided to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least by 20% in 2020 compared to 1990 and to supply 20% of energy needs by 2020 from renewable energy sources. This paper uses an energy model coupled with a non-CO2 greenhouse gas model to assess the range of policy options that were debated to meet both targets. Policy options include trading of renewable targets, carbon trading in power plants and industry and the use of the Clean Development Mechanism to improve cost-efficiency. The models also examined fairness by analysing the distribution of emission reduction in the non-emission trading sector, the distribution of CO2 allowances in the emission trading sector and the reallocation of renewable targets across Member States. The overall costs of meeting both targets range from 0.4% to 0.6% of GDP in 2020 for the EU as a whole. The redistribution mechanisms employed significantly improve fairness compared to a cost-effective solution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

646894,Models of reforestation productivity and carbon sequestration for land use and climate change adaptation planning in South Australia,"Environmental management and regional land use planning has become more complex in recent years as growing world population, climate change, carbon markets and government policies for sustainability have emerged. Reforestation and agroforestry options for environmental benefits, carbon sequestration, economic development and biodiversity conservation are now important considerations of land use planners. New information has been collected and regionally-calibrated models have been developed to facilitate better regional land use planning decisions and counter the limitations of currently available models of reforestation productivity and carbon sequestration. Surveys of above-ground biomass of 264 reforestation sites (132 woodlots, 132 environmental plantings) within the agricultural regions of South Australia were conducted, and combined with spatial information on climate and soils, to develop new spatial and temporal models of plant density and above-ground biomass productivity from reforestation. The models can be used to estimate productivity and total carbon sequestration (i.e. aboveground + below-ground biomass) under a continuous range of planting designs (e.g. variable proportions of trees and shrubs or plant densities), timeframes and future climate scenarios. Representative spatial models (1 ha resolution) for 3 reforestation designs (i.e.,woodlots, typical environmental planting, biodiverse environmental plantings) x 3 timeframes (i.e. 25, 45, 65 years) x 4 possible climates (i.e. no change, mild, moderate, severe warming and drying) were generated (i.e. 36 scenarios) for use within land use planning tools.

721831,How policy choice affects investment in low-carbon technology: The case of CO2 capture in indirect coal liquefaction in China,"An improved understanding of investment decisions on low-carbon technology will greatly facilitate assessing the effectiveness of carbon emissions mitigation policies. We use the example of implementing CCS (carbon capture and storage) within ICL (indirect coal liquefaction), a controversial technology in China, by constructing a RO (real options) model for the investment decision-making process to assess how different climate policies affect low-carbon technology investors under highly uncertain circumstances. We find that a carbon tax provides the strongest signal for investment and that a market-based measure provides firms with flexibility. Moreover, different types of carbon markets generate substantially different effects on firm behavior, and the CO2 price level exerts a more powerful influence on investors than market volatility or the policy's implementation date. Considering the regional disparities among the coal-abundant but less-developed provinces and the affluent coastal regions in China, we suggest that a sub-national CDM (clean development mechanism) would complete the current domestic policy framework to balance the development requirement and CO2 abatement, whereas extraordinary administrative efforts are necessary to raise the current price of CO2 credits to an effective level, to broaden the carbon market coverage and consolidate the carbon market foundation.

693191,GLOBAL EFFECTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECOTAX,"The aim of this paper is to analyse the implications of the European Commission proposal of a mixed energy cum carbon tax to curb CO2 emissions from a global perspective. The paper deals with the effects of this proposal on emissions and welfare in both the EC and the rest of the world by concentrating on three main issues : i) the effectiveness of the proposed tax measures in terms of curbing EC and global CO2 emissions; ii) the implied costs for the EC and the other countries/regions of the worlds ; and iii) the implications of the EC proposal for the world distribution of emissions and the competitiveness of the EC economy. In this connection, the relevance of the so-called ''carbon leakages'' - i.e. the displacement of polluting activities from countries participating in an emission reduction agreement to countries not concerned by the agreement - is examined.

400905,Carbon Taxation and Policy Labeling: Experience from American States and Canadian Provinces,"A vast economics literature embraces taxation of the carbon content of fossil fuels as the superior policy approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, experience around the world suggests that carbon taxes face exceedingly difficult political hurdles. Federal experience in the United States and in Canada confirms this pattern. This article reviews sub-federal policy development among American states and Canadian provinces, a great many of which have pursued climate policy development. With one major exception, explicit carbon taxation appears to remain a political nonstarter. At the same time, states and provinces have been placing indirect carbon prices on fossil fuel use through a wide range of policies. These tend to strategically alter labeling, avoiding the terms of tax and carbon in imposing costs.

Known as the Tailoring Rule, this regulation makes key adjustments to the statutory thresholds for permitting requirements in order to finally bring stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions under federal regulation. This Note argues that the Tailoring Rule demonstrates how agencies serve a critical function in the context of public policy. Where the inherent characteristics of ""wicked problems"" like climate change prevent Congress from passing legislation, delegation to agencies provides renewed potential for government action that reflects the public interest. The classic advantages of administrative power, such as insulation, flexibility, and expertise, are particularly important in the context of ""wicked problems"" in two ways. First, delegation to agencies can ensure action where politics would otherwise prevent new legislation. Second, it can ensure that the public interest is prioritized over economic interests, providing more effective regulation.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

In this paper we argue that climate change challenges the region to maintain its economic viability, but also holds some opportunities that may enhance economic development, human well-being, and social justice. To face these challenges and seize these opportunities effectively we must better understand adaptation capacities, opportunities and constraints, the social processes of adaptation, approaches for engaging critical players and the broader public in informed debate, decision-making, and conscious interventions in the adaptation process. This paper offers a preliminary qualitative assessment, in which we emphasize the need for (1) assessing the feasibility and side effects of technological adaptation options, (2) increasing available resources and improving equitable access to them, (3) increasing institutional flexibility, fit, cooperation and decision-making authority, (4) using and enhancing human and social capital, (5) improving access to insurance and other risk-spreading mechanisms, and (6) linking scientific information more effectively to decision-makers while engaging the public.

A post-Kyoto regulation to combat global warming is not yet stipulated. Due to rapidly increasing greenhouse-gas emission levels, industrialized countries urge major polluters from the developing world like China and India to participate in a future agreement. Whether these developing countries will do so, depends on the prevailing incentives to participate in international climate protection efforts.

88305,"Adaptation benefits and costs of raising coastal buildings under storm-tide inundation in South East Queensland, Australia","Pathways of adapting the built assets for future risk reduction are highly uncertain because of changes in socio-economic trends and climate. To provide solid foundation for better adaptation planning, this paper presents a statistical approach to investigate the future direct damage loss and the benefit of adaptation through elevating building floors of residential and commercial buildings affected by storm-tide hazard and sea-level rise in South East Queensland, Australia, particularly the implication of different extents of adaptation to policies. Because of projected socio-economic growth, it was found that, if considered separately, building stock growth causes twice as large as sea-level rise does to the potential damage loss. Adaptation by elevating new buildings alone is more cost-effective and socially acceptable than by elevating both new and old buildings. It is concluded that even with limited adaptation, immediate but less long-term net benefits could be achieved by focusing adaptation on the most vulnerable coastal housing. Somewhat pre-emptive adaptation that lifts more coastal housing in wider coastal area in the immediate term to accommodate future storm tides gives longer-term net benefits, though incurs higher adaptation costs. However, too much over-adapting may be undesirable as it incurs unreasonably high initial and on-going costs while the benefits of it could only be reaped over unrealistically long time. Geographical extent of asset adaptation should be decided in accordance with the planning time horizon to avoid either under- or over-adaptation.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

577582,Willingness to Pay for Carbon Sequestration and Co-Benefits of Forests in Turkey,"Scientists express concern about increasing levels of greenhouse gases mainly due to fossil fuel consumption and deforestation. In response to the latter, policy-makers have introduced a range of policy measures to conserve and enhance forest ecosystems for carbon sequestration. The costs for policy measures to maintain ecosystem services can be calculated easily, but especially non-market/non-use benefits of forests are not easy to estimate. Economics can help designing climate change policies by eliciting public preferences on different attributes of climate change and carbon sequestration. This study was prepared for the purpose of identifying per capita consumer/equivalent surplus or maximum willingness to pay and the total economic value in relation to forests to be established in Turkey to reduce air pollution around cities, to prevent the adverse effects of climate change and to sequester carbon. The data for the estimation of maximum willingness to pay, total economic value and co-benefits of forests were collected with a questionnaire form prepared according to the contingent valuation method. Analyses have been conducted by correlation analysis and regression analysis.

661241,Impact of urbanization on US surface climate,"We combine Landsat and MODIS data in a land model to assess the impact of urbanization on US surface climate. For cities built within forests, daytime urban land surface temperature (LST) is much higher than that of vegetated lands. For example, in Washington DC and Atlanta, daytime mean temperature differences between impervious and vegetated lands reach 3.3 and 2.0 degrees C, respectively. Conversely, for cities built within arid lands, such as Phoenix, urban areas are 2.2 degrees C cooler than surrounding shrubs. We find that the choice and amount of tree species in urban settings play a commanding role in modulating cities' LST. At continental and monthly scales, impervious surfaces are 1.9 degrees C +/- 0.6 degrees C warmer than surroundings during summer and expel 12% of incoming precipitation as surface runoff compared to 3.2% over vegetation. We also show that the carbon lost to urbanization represents 1.8% of the continental total, a striking number considering urbanization occupies only 1.1% of the US land. With a small areal extent, urbanization has significant effects on surface energy, water and carbon budgets and reveals an uneven impact on surface climate that should inform upon policy options for improving urban growth including heat mitigation and carbon sequestration.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
60695,Modeling adaptation as a flow and stock decision with mitigation,"An effective policy response to climate change will include, among other things, investments in lowering greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation), as well as short-term temporary (flow) and long-lived capital-intensive (stock) adaptation to climate change. A critical near-term question is how investments in reducing climate damages should be allocated across these elements of a climate policy portfolio, especially in the face of uncertainty in both future climate damages and also the effectiveness of yet-untested adaptation efforts. We build on recent efforts in DICE-based integrated assessment modeling approaches that include two types of adaptation-short-lived flow spending and long-lived depreciable adaptation stock investments-along with mitigation, and we identify and explore the uncertainties that impact the relative proportions of policies within a response portfolio. We demonstrate that the relative ratio of flow adaptation, stock adaptation, and mitigation depend critically on interactions among: 1) the relative effectiveness in the baseline of stock versus flow adaptation, 2) the degree of substitutability between stock and flow adaptation types, and 3) whether there exist physical limits on the amount of damages that can be reduced by flow-type adaptation investments. The results indicate where more empirical research on adaptation could focus to best inform near-term policy decisions, and provide a first step towards considering near-term policies that are flexible in the face of uncertainty.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1060263,The Stimuli-Actions-Effects-Responses (SAER)-framework for exploring perceived relationships between private and public climate change adaptation in agriculture,"Empirical findings on actors' roles and responsibilities in the climate change adaptation process are rare even though cooperation between private and public actors is perceived important to foster adaptation in agriculture. We therefore developed the framework SAER (Stimuli-Actions-Effects-Responses) to investigate perceived relationships between private and public climate change adaptation in agriculture at regional scale. In particular, we explore agricultural experts' perceptions on (i) climatic and non climatic factors stimulating private adaptation, (ii) farm adaption actions, (iii) potential on-farm and off-farm effects from adaptation, and (iv) the relationships between private and public adaptation. The SAER-framework is built on a comprehensive literature review and empirical findings from semi structured interviews with agricultural experts from two case study regions in Austria. We find that private adaptation is perceived as incremental, systemic or transformational. It is typically stimulated by a mix of bio-physical and socio-economic on-farm and off-farm factors. Stimulating factors related to climate change are perceived of highest relevance for systemic and transformational adaptation whereas already implemented adaptation is mostly perceived to be incremental. Perceived effects of private adaptation are related to the environment, weather and climate, quality and quantity of agricultural products as well as human, social and economic resources. Our results also show that public adaptation can influence factors stimulating private adaptation as well as adaptation effects through the design and development of the legal, policy and organizational environment as well as the provision of educational, informational, financial, and technical infrastructure. Hence, facilitating existing and new collaborations between private and public actors may enable farmers to adapt effectively to climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

742557,Distributional effects of carbon taxation,"The carbon tax is a frequently discussed economic instrument for carbon emissions mitigation and prevention of global climate change. However, a range of issues may emerge when introducing a carbon tax; among these issues, the distributional impact has been frequently highlighted as an obstacle to the public acceptance of such a mitigation policy. This literature review focuses specifically on the distributional effects of carbon taxes and contributes to existing studies by providing a classification and discussion on how to comprehensively assess distributional impacts and what measures can be taken to mitigate the potential adverse distributional impact We confirm that a pure carbon tax without revenue recycling in developed economies tends to be regressive, i.e. lower income households being more affected, while our research does not support the perception that it reveals progressivity in developing countries. In terms of its effects on economic sectors, we find that sectors with higher energy intensity are more affected by a uniform carbon tax, while preferential measures to protect these industries face a trade-off between environmental effectiveness and economic growth. We also stress that different designs for carbon tax mechanisms play a key role in affecting the distributional impacts and impacts in other policy arenas, indicating that trade-offs between efficiency and equity always exist when designing a carbon tax. This study may help to identify the shortcomings of existing designs and puts forward practical implications for future research; moreover, it offers valuable information to help policy-makers to understand the trade-off between equity and efficiency when designing a carbon tax.

456821,Environmental and technology policies for climate mitigation,"We assess different policies for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and promoting innovation and diffusion of renewable energy. We evaluate the relative performance of policies according to incentives provided for emissions reduction, efficiency, and other outcomes. We also assess how the nature of technological progress through learning and research and development (R&D), and the degree of knowledge spillovers, affects the desirability of different policies. Due to knowledge spillovers, optimal policy involves a portfolio of different instruments targeted at emissions, learning, and R&D. Although the relative cost of individual policies in achieving reductions depends on parameter values and the emissions target, in a numerical application to the U.S. electricity sector, the ranking is roughly as follows: (1) emissions price, (2) emissions performance standard, (3) fossil power tax, (4) renewables share requirement, (5) renewables subsidy, and (6) R&D subsidy. Nonetheless, an optimal portfolio of policies achieves emissions reductions at a significantly lower cost than any single policy. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

619394,Hot air for sale: a quantitative assessment of Russia's near-term climate policy options,"Since January 2005 the European Union has launched an EU-internal emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) for emission-intensive installations as the central pillar to comply with the Kyoto Protocol. The EU ETS will be linked to a Kyoto emissions market where greenhouse gas emission allowances of signatory Kyoto countries can be traded. In this paper we investigate the implications of Russian market power for environmental effectiveness and regional compliance costs to the Kyoto Protocol taking into account potential linkages between the Kyoto emissions market and the EU ETS. We find that Russia may have incentives to join the EU ETS as long as the latter remains relatively separated from the Kyoto international emissions market. In this case, Russia can exert monopolistic price discrimination between two separated markets thereby maximizing revenues from hot air sales. The EU will be able to substantially reduce compliance costs if it does not restrain itself to EU-internal emission regulation schemes. However, part of the gains from extra-EU emissions trading will come at the expense of environmental effectiveness as (more) hot air will be drawn in.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

This paper examines to what extent the perceptions of political actors might hinder the development of adaptation policies. We study the Swiss case using computer aided textual analysis. Our results demonstrate that adaptation is still not perceived as an important dimension of climate change policy. Decision makers do not perceive links between adaptation, the Swiss economy and the energy supply. Adaptation is mainly considered an issue for developing countries and not as a way to reduce the impacts of climate change in Switzerland. Right-wing parties tend to consider adaptation a secondary issue and are more likely than those to the left to object to the formulation or the implementation of public measures.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
617052,Coordinating climate and trade policies: Pareto efficiency and the role of border tax adjustments,"This paper explores the role of trade instruments in globally efficient climate policies, focusing on whether or not some form of border tax adjustment (BTA) is warranted when carbon prices differ internationally. The analysis shows that, while there is no case for BTA when all instruments can be freely deployed, Pareto-efficiency does require a form of BTA when carbon taxes in some countries are constrained: its purpose then is to partly counteract the impact on emissions of inappropriate carbon pricing there, or, equivalently, to undo the trade distortions such pricing creates. The required form of BTA is generally complex, but a special case is identified in which it optimally has the simple structure envisaged in practical policy discussions. It is also shown that the efficiency case for BTA depends critically on whether climate policies are pursued by carbon taxation or by cap-and-trade. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

384846,Putting carbon markets into practice: a case study of financial accounting in Europe,"In this paper we explore how carbon markets have entered the world of financial accounting. The advent of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in 2005 provided the opportunity for global climate change concerns to be translated from policy into something that could, and should, be recognised within financial accounting. That is, the EU ETS provided a mechanism whereby greenhouse gas emission allowances acquired a financial value, simultaneously creating an obligation (or liability) on certain European organisations when they emit greenhouse gases. Prima facie, this process created the need for financial accounts of companies covered by the EU ETS to reflect the new commodity of carbon. Disagreement amongst accountants about how to treat emission allowances has arisen, with the initial international accounting guidance issued in late 2004 subsequently being withdrawn, and not yet replaced. Taking this absence of guidance as a starting point, we undertake an empirical project (through a survey, consultation analysis, and interviews) to establish what financial reporting practices are being adopted by participants in the EU ETS, and the level of momentum for standardisation. We draw on sociological theories about accounting, measurement, and markets.",,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
651811,Development of Taiwanese government's climate policy after the Kyoto protocol: Applying policy network theory as an analytical framework,"Given its limited involvement in and recognition by international organizations, Taiwan is not presently a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) or the Kyoto Protocol. The objective of this study is to analyze how and the extent to which changes in an exogenous factor, namely the Kyoto Protocol and Post-Kyoto climate negotiations, affect and ultimately lead to the formulation of and changes in the Taiwanese government's climate policy. This study applies policy network theory to examine the development of and changes in the Taiwanese government's climate policy. The results demonstrate that international climate agreements and negotiations play a key role in the development of, changes to, and transformation of Taiwan's climate policy. Scarce evidence was found in this study to demonstrate that domestic or internal factors affect climate change policy. Despite its lack of participation in the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, Taiwan has adopted national climate change strategies, action plans, and programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, these climate policies and measures are fairly passive and aim to only conform to the minimal requirements for developing countries under international climate agreements and negotiations. This process results in inconsistent and variable climate policies, targets, and regulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

57458,Understanding the nuclear controversy: An application of cultural theory,"The need for a secure and sustainable energy future has become firmly entrenched on the global political agenda. Governments worldwide are seeking solutions that will ensure security of their energy supplies, while reducing carbon emissions in the fight against climate change. Advocates of nuclear power have reframed the technology as the most reliable, cost-effective and immediate solution to both of these policy problems, and predicted the emergence of a 'nuclear renaissance'. However, there is little evidence to date that suggests a nuclear renaissance has actually taken place. Public opinion polling demonstrates that many remain unconvinced of the need for nuclear power. This paper uses Cultural Theory as a heuristic to understand why the arguments for a nuclear renaissance have been largely unsuccessful. It argues that the failure of nuclear advocates to engage with a wider cross-section of world-views has prevented the controversy surrounding nuclear power from being resolved, and the nuclear renaissance from becoming a reality. In doing so, this paper builds upon a growing recognition of the contribution that social science research can make to understanding public acceptance of energy policy choices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Important requirement for practically applicable models of marine diesel engines was, firstly, the need for a minimization of data set on the engine parameters and, secondly, the calibration of models to achieve the required accuracy in fuel consumption calculating. The classification of the internal combustion engine models was designed. It was shown that only the simplest models of operational processes based on nonlinear equations or formal approximations are practically applicable for voyage planning and regulations of fuel consumption. As an example, a simple algorithm for modeling a river diesel engine was presented based on the use of the ideal Trinkler cycle. The relevant calculations of the propeller characteristic enclosed.

In this paper, the North China Plain in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) is selected as a typical regional social-ecological system; with historical information kept in official documents, social responsive behavior and measures to flood/drought (e.g., reclamation, disaster relief, migration, revolt) are quantitatively described with proxy indicator time-series. It is found that the dominant responsive strategy altered significantly in different stages: (1) stage of cropland expansion (1644-1720); (2) stage of governmental disaster relief (1721-1780); (3) stage of increasing climate refugees (1781-1860); (4) stage of revolt and emigration (1861-1911). The multi-stage evolution of social response was impacted by various natural and social factors: (1) regional population-food balance and governmental finance were the most important limiting factors; (2) the interaction between the governmental policy and refugees' behavior in disasters affected the social consequences to a certain extent; (3) decadal-to-multi-decadal climate change would also impact the social response measures, even directly trigger the shift of dominant responsive strategy.

99773,Assessing the sustainability challenges for electricity industries in ASEAN newly industrialising countries,"Rapid social and economic progress in fast developing countries such that among the countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have driven substantial growth in electricity consumption in this region. Whilst this represents significant societal and economic development, it has potentially growing adverse environmental impacts. This raises a concern on sustainable development in the electricity sector in this region. This study evaluates key sustainability challenges in the electricity industries in the five largest energy consumers in ASEAN: Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The 3A's energy sustainability objectives: Accessibility, Availability and Acceptability are used as the sustainability analytical framework. This study also draws together a set of associated indicators and criteria within the analytical framework to analyse the status of the electricity industries in these countries. The analysis shows that key sustainability challenges in the ASEAN-5 are attributable to satisfying rapid demand growth; enhancing security of electricity supply; and mitigating the increase in CO2 emissions from electricity generation. Given the promising resource and technical potential in this region, renewable energy emerges as a favourable option to address these challenges; however, increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity generation requires considerable policy support. This study suggests that there is an opportunity for the ASEAN countries to strengthen regional collaborations through experience and resource sharing to enhance sustainability in the electricity industries.This study also highlights some of the key issues facing the electricity industry, and the need for new generation investment decision support tools which can address these issues.

Using groundwater as a complimentary source of water has provided an effective means to satisfy the ever-increasing water demands and deal with surface water shortages problems due to robust capability of groundwater in responding to climate change. Conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is crucial for integrated water resources management. It is helpful to reduce vulnerabilities of water supply systems and mitigate the water supply stress in responding to climate change.

237455,Probabilistic cost estimates for climate change mitigation,"For more than a decade, the target of keeping global warming below 2 degrees C has been a key focus of the international climate debate(1). In response, the scientific community has published a number of scenario studies that estimate the costs of achieving such a target(2-5). Producing these estimates remains a challenge, particularly because of relatively well known, but poorly quantified, uncertainties, and owing to limited integration of scientific knowledge across disciplines(6). The integrated assessment community, on the one hand, has extensively assessed the influence of technological and socio-economic uncertainties on low-carbon scenarios and associated costs(2-4,7). The climate modelling community, on the other hand, has spent years improving its understanding of the geophysical response of the Earth system to emissions of greenhouse gases(8-12). This geophysical response remains a key uncertainty in the cost of mitigation scenarios but has been integrated with assessments of other uncertainties in only a rudimentary manner, that is, for equilibrium conditions(6,13). Here we bridge this gap between the two research communities by generating distributions of the costs associated with limiting transient global temperature increase to below specific values, taking into account uncertainties in four factors: geophysical, technological, social and political. Wefind that political choices that delay mitigation have the largest effect on the cost-risk distribution, followed by geophysical uncertainties, social factors influencing future energy demand and, lastly, technological uncertainties surrounding the availability of greenhouse gas mitigation options. Our information on temperature risk and mitigation costs provides crucial information for policy-making, because it clarifies the relative importance of mitigation costs, energy demand and the timing of global action in reducing the risk of exceeding a global temperature increase of 2 degrees C, or other limits such as 3 degrees C or 1.5 degrees C, across a wide range of scenarios.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
437594,Urban Energy Policies and the Governance of Multilevel Issues in Cape Town,"The multiscalar challenges associated with urban energy policies are the cause of extensive interaction among multiple levels of government and social forces. However, these multilevel systems of action tend to reflect complex and unstable power and resistance patterns rather than stable co-operation processes. Thus, in this paper, a multilevel governance perspective is used as a starting point for understanding where and how multilevel interactions arise in an energy system as well as which issues are creating political conflict and the related consequences for the governance of urban energy policies. This approach is illustrated through a case study of Cape Town, which exemplifies a situation of conflicting policy and agendas at different levels of government, thus creating a great dispersion of initiatives across different scales. Integrating these initiatives within a broader coherent framework, however, is not only a technical matter. As urban energy policies deal with multilevel issues, they imply negotiating dynamic and complex compromises between different types of organisations and authorities while shaping their governance is also a matter of politics.",1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
565628,Brazilian low-carbon transportation policies: opportunities for international support,"Two transport policies with climate co-benefits for the intra-city and inter-city transport in Brazil are analysed. Both policies aim to shift transport from the road (cars in cities, trucks between cities) towards less energy-intensive transport modes (bus, underground, rail and shipping). The main motivations for these policies are domestic benefits, including reduced energy costs, fewer accidents, and reduced local congestion and pollution. Despite these apparent benefits, barriers and financing constraints limit the scale and scope of the policy formulation and are likely to further impact their implementation. While it is relatively easy to mobilize investment in transport logistics infrastructure at the national level, given the benefits for economic competitiveness for the country as a whole, it is more challenging to leverage funds to provide more efficient and integrated public transport systems at the city level. International cooperation can play a significant role in supporting domestic policies, and thus contribute to direct emissions reductions and lower-carbon growth trajectories through a modal shift. Policy relevance: A modal shift of freight and passenger transport would enhance the energy efficiency of transport services. In Brazil, like most developing countries, infrastructure constraints prevent such a modal shift. Barriers to implementing national policies can differ within a country as well as internationally; for example, financial constraints are far more severe for cities pursuing public transport projects than for federal projects on inter-city freight transport. This creates opportunities for international support to tackle specific barriers and thus help governments to deliver domestic policy objectives. In order to avoid merely subsidizing the transport sector and increasing transport volumes, international support has to focus on measures to facilitate a modal shift that underpins a broader national transport strategy.",,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
523464,Analysis of the effect of global climate change on ground source heat pump systems in different climate categories,"Ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems exhibit high thermal performance. Consequently, they are increasingly used to heat and cool buildings. The thermal performance of GSHP systems strongly depends on the operation ground temperature and thermal quality of the building envelope (TQBE). The operation ground temperature is a function of mean annual air temperature and annual thermal load of the building. The thermal load depends on the TQBE and outside temperature. Given that ongoing global climate change (GCC) affects air temperatures, it also affects the performance of GSHP systems. The magnitude of this impact on a given GSHP system strongly depends on local weather conditions and the TQBE. The overall aim of the current study is to investigate the impact of GCC on the performance of GSHP systems in different climate. To achieve this aim, three cities located in three climate categories were considered: Stockholm, Sweden (cold), Istanbul, Turkey (mild), and Doha, Qatar (hot). In each city, two buildings were modeled. One was built according to current local building regulations, while the other was built to have a TQBE lower than the standard TQBE. Simulations were run for present (2014) and future (projected for 2050) outdoor designing conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

1254555,Local Authority Responses to Climate Change in South Africa: The Challenges of Transboundary Governance,"Recent progress and innovation are testament to the willingness of municipal authorities to address climate change. However, urban regions worldwide exhibit an immense diversity of conditions, capabilities and responses to the challenges of changing climatic conditions. While separated by politico-administrative borders, adjacent municipalities within such regions are connected through biophysical, politico-economic, and social systems likely to be reconfigured under changing climatic/environmental conditions. Yet, to date, politico-administrative borders have largely determined the parameters of local government climate change adaptation strategies, with insufficient attention to the role of inter-municipal collaboration, especially between neighbouring rural, peri-urban and urban municipalities, for co-ordinating such policies and interventions. Within a multi-level governance framework, this paper considers the recent evolution of climate agendas in the eThekwini (formerly Durban City Council) metropolitan municipality and the adjacent Ugu (predominantly rural) district municipality on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal province (KZN), South Africa, focusing particularly on cross-border collaboration within the greater city region. The challenges were investigated by means of 53 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with municipal, regional and local authority association staff in November 2009, March 2012, and August 2017. Our core argument is that weak inter-municipal collaboration, particularly between urban, peri-urban and rural areas within metropolitan and functional city regions, has been a significant impediment to realizing transformative adaptation within such regions. The experiences of these two contiguous yet contrasting municipalities represent a microcosm of the dramatic discontinuities and inequalities on all variables within adjacent urban metropolitan and rural contexts in South Africa and beyond. Despite promising recent signs, the challenges of inter-municipal collaborative action are therefore formidable.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1866970,Justice and Equity Implications of Climate Change Adaptation: A Theoretical Evaluation Framework,"Climate change affects human health, and climate change adaptation aims to reduce these risks through infrastructural, behavioral, and technological measures. However, attributing direct human health effects to climate change adaptation is difficult, causing an ethical dilemma between the need for evidence of strategies and their precautionary implementation before such evidence has been generated. In the absence of conclusive evidence for individual adaptation strategies, alternative approaches to the measurement of adaptation effectiveness need to be developed. This article proposes a theoretical framework and a set of guiding questions to assess effects of adaptation strategies on seven domains of health determinants, including social, economic, infrastructure, institutional, community, environmental, and cultural determinants of health. Its focus on advancing gender equity and environmental justice concurrently with the implementation of health-related adaptation could serve as a template for policymakers and researchers.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2991,A global ocean observing system framework for sustainable development,"Sustainable development depends on maintaining ecosystem services which are concentrated in coastal marine and estuarine ecosystems. Analyses of the science needed to manage human uses of ecosystem services have concentrated on terrestrial ecosystems. Our focus is on the provision of multidisciplinary data needed to inform adaptive, ecosystem-based approaches (EBAs) for maintaining coastal ecosystem services based on comparative ecosystem analyses. Key indicators of pressures on coastal ecosystems, ecosystem states and the impacts of changes in states on services are identified for monitoring and analysis at a global coastal network of sentinel sites nested in the ocean-climate observing system. Biodiversity is targeted as the ""master"" indicator because of its importance to a broad spectrum of services. Ultimately, successful implementation of EBAs will depend on establishing integrated, holistic approaches to ocean governance that oversee the development of integrated, operational ocean observing systems based on the data and information requirements specified by a broad spectrum of stakeholders for sustainable development. Sustained engagement of such a spectrum of stakeholders on a global scale is not feasible. The global coastal network will need to be customized locally and regionally based on priorities established by stakeholders in their respective regions. The E.U. Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the U.S. Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force are important examples of emerging regional scale approaches. The effectiveness of these policies will depend on the co-evolution of ocean policy and the observing system under the auspices of integrated ocean governance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

737776,REDD plus for Red Books? Negotiating rights to land and livelihoods through carbon governance in the Central Highlands of Vietnam,"In Vietnam, initial programs to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) have proliferated through international finance and new governance regimes for climate change mitigation. National capacity and legal frameworks have been adjusted to make the country eligible for REDD + financing. In some local areas, activities have been implemented to 'produce' carbon credits intended for the international voluntary carbon market. Through a case study of a pilot REDD + project in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, we examine how REDD + has intersected with property rights institutions and agrarian change to influence changing property relations and commodity markets. Our findings show that REDD + implemented through state and local institutions has articulated with the local political economy to coproduce conditions that embody local norms, needs, and desires. Specifically, local actors negotiate state-sanctioned tenurial instruments used for REDD + governance, not for the purposes of carbon sequestration but instead in order to reassert their rights to land and forest for the cultivation of boom crops the antithesis of REDD + objectives. In the fine balancing act of adjusting local forestland holdings, REDD + implementation has effectively facilitated increased opportunities for upland villagers to strategically claim land titles from local political authorities in the form of communal land certificates for forests called 'Red Books'. In securing communal Red Books, villagers redefine or co-constitute the purpose of REDD + to secure land for cash crop and commercial timber production. As with other forms of environmental governance, REDD + is thus co-constituted locally in line with state and local institutions and histories and present day realities.",,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1858981,A Comparison of Carbon Emission Trading Systems in New Zealand and Canada: Diversity is Not a Virtue in Carbon Law and Policy,"Carbon emission trading has emerged as a primary means to address climate change. Trading systems operate across the globe, and the linkage of these systems will be a component in the post-Kyoto international climate framework. This paper examines the design and operation of trading systems in Alberta, Quebec, and New Zealand. The paper evaluates each of these systems in relation to (1) its impact on reducing carbon emissions, (2) its effectiveness at price discovery for carbon, and (3) its potential to link with other systems. The paper concludes that the cap-and-trade system operating in Quebec is superior on each of these measures. This study also highlights the diversity in carbon law and policy across jurisdictions today, and suggests that international climate negotiations should focus on the development of common design parameters to guide the operation of national or subnational carbon emission trading systems going forward.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

797982,Implications of global emission policy scenarios for domestic agriculture: a New Zealand case study,"Agricultural GHG mitigation policies are important if ambitious climate change goals are to be achieved, and have the potential to significantly lower global mitigation costs [Reisinger, A., Havlik, P., Riahi, K., van Vliet, O., Obersteiner, M., & Herrero, M. (2013). Implications of alternative metrics for global mitigation costs and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Climatic Change, 117, 677-690]. In the post-Paris world of nationally determined contributions' to mitigation, the prospects for agricultural mitigation policies may rest on whether they are in the national economic interest of large agricultural producers. New Zealand is a major exporter of livestock products; this article uses New Zealand as a case study to consider the policy implications of three global policy scenarios at the global, national and farm levels. Building on global modelling, a model dairy farm and a model sheep and beef farm are used to estimate the changes in profit when agricultural emissions are priced and mitigated globally or not, and priced domestically or not, in 2020. Related to these scenarios is the metric or GHG exchange rate. Most livestock emissions are non-CO2, with methane being particularly sensitive to the choice of metric. The results provide evidence that farm profitability is more sensitive to differing international policy scenarios than national economic welfare. The impact of the choice of metric is not as great as the impact of whether other countries mitigate agricultural emissions or not. Livestock farmers do best when agricultural emissions are not priced, as livestock commodity prices rise significantly due to competition for land from forestry. However, efficient farmers may still see a rise in profitability when agricultural emissions are fully priced worldwide.Policy relevanceExempting agricultural emissions from mitigation significantly increases the costs of limiting warming to 2 degrees C, placing the burden on other sectors. However, there may be a large impact on farmers if agricultural emissions are priced domestically when other countries are not doing the same. The impacts of global and national climate policies on farmers need to be better understood in order for climate policies to be politically sustainable. Transitional assistance that is not linked to emission levels could help, as long as the incentives to mitigate are maintained. In the long run, efficient farmers may benefit from climate policy; international efforts should focus on mitigation options and effective domestic policy development, rather than on metrics.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
